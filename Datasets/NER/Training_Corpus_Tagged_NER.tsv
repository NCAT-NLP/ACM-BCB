Unfortunately	O
,	O
the	O

we	O
had	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
sacrificed	O
during	O
that	O
time	O
was	O
squandered	O
by	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
selfish	O
individuals	O
that	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
party	O
and	O
live	O
it	O
up	O
.	O
Now	O
it	O
's	O
mid	O
-	O
June	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
're	O
seeing	O
the	O
spike	O
from	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
may	O
not	O
have	O
rushed	O
out	O
the	O
second	O
the	O
lockdown	DIST
was	O
over	O
,	O
but	O
waited	O
a	O
couple	O
weeks	O
after	O
.	O
If	O
we	O
had	O
adequate	O
testing	TEST
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
lockdown	DIST
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
necessary	O
.	O
They	O
went	O
on	O
a	O
total	O

and	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
reopen	O
....	O
without	O
a	O

Then	O
he	O
doubled	O
down	O

said	O
even	O
after	O
all	O

this	O
he	O
would	O
n't	O
change	O
anything	O

including	O
not	O

the	O
original	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
have	O
spoken	O
loudly	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
fucking	O
stupid	O
,	O
they	O
're	O
against	O

masks	PPE
,	O
and	O
now	O
we	O
have	O
an	O
ugly	O
compromise	O
.	O
If	O
we	O
lockdown	DIST
,	O
people	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
just	O
fight	O
it	O
harder	O

It	O
's	O
not	O

with	O

after	O
the	O

Arizona	O

now	O
people	O
take	O
it	O
as	O
a	O

that	O
once	O
we	O

will	O
change	O

people	O
wanted	O
that	O

because	O
we	O
were	O

some	O

the	O

The	O
concern	O
is	O
that	O
low	O

be	O

doing	O

wonder	O
if	O
this	O
was	O
from	O
when	O
the	O

I	O
'm	O
beginning	O
to	O

you	O
're	O
a	O
liberal	O
who	O
is	O
pretending	O
to	O
be	O
a	O

on	O
every	O

you	O
believe	O
about	O

Besides	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
antigen tests	TEST
only	O
have	O
a	O
high	O
false negative	TEST
rate	O
.	O
The	O
concern	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
result	O
in	O
a	O

they	O
fail	O

someone	O

COVID-19	O

Lots	O

false negatives	TEST

false	O

My	O

had	O
the	O
test	O

they	O
were	O
told	O
by	O

that	O
it	O
actually	O
results	O
in	O
a	O
ton	O
of	O
false negatives	TEST

The	O
problem	O
I	O
see	O
is	O
that	O
this	O
test	O
has	O
a	O
higher	O

what	O
I	O
read	O
,	O
the	O
antigen tests	TEST
are	O
more	O
prone	O

so	O
they	O
confirm	O
the	O

with	O
a	O

maybe	O
a	O

find	O
it	O

think	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
happening	O

not	O
reported	O

the	O

at	O

Right	O
now	O
the	O
odds	O

greater	O
that	O
you	O

that	O

for	O
both	O

us	O
to	O

would	O
be	O
some	O
really	O
bad	O

From	O
what	O
I	O
have	O

false negatives	TEST
can	O
happen	O

I	O
mentioned	O
above	O

I	O
would	O

false negatives	TEST
are	O
a	O

false	O

.	O
most	O
tests	TEST
have	O
a	O

if	O
you	O
