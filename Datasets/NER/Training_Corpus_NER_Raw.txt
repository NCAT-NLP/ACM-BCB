On the plus side, our 0%_positive is trending down.
July 16 had 69 cases (15.3%_positive), July 17 had 57 cases (13.9%_positive) and July 23 had 64 cases (19.4%_positive).
- 0%_positive from all tests administered 1-7 days ago: 9.4%
- 0%_positive from all tests administered 8-14 days ago: 25.3%
- 0%_positive from all tests administered 15-21 days ago: 15.8%
Overall 0%_positive graphs are on the third tab.

7778 PCR_tests, 16%_positive rate after deducting an estimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.137).
The overall 0%_positive was 19.54% on the 13,317 tests they processed on Thursday (93% of the tests were PCR’s).
14907 PCR_tests, 19%_positive rate after deducting an estimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.137).
I imagine our 0%_positive will stay a bit high (artificially) as many of the public are no longer in a hurry to get tested.
20,477 PCR_tests, 14%_positive rate after deducting an estimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.137).
If you scroll to the far right on my spreadsheet there is a tab for "Daily 0%_positive".
The 0%positive of the week is pretty well established with only 50 to 60% of the tests reported and we really should be looking at 0%_positive vs.
Now, once we get to sub 5%_positive tests and we want to start doing contact tracing, if we aren't getting tests back in 24-48 hours then that's a problem.
11837 PCR_tests, 19%_positive rate after deducting an estimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.136).
10498 PCR_tests, 19%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.135).
12,589 PCR_tests, 16%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.149).
So we seem to have at least for now be seeing a stabilization in the 0%_positive rate.
I made a post about this yesterday, but I don't think Sonora is using "normal" math to arrive at their 0%_positive rates.
Date | Cases | Positives | 0%_positive.
I double checked today and same thing, tests from 2 weeks ago are reporting over 20%_positive.
Adding in those backlogged tests would raise the positivity number because, well, they were over 20% - doesn't matter if there are a few of them or a lot of them, if they're over 20%_positive, it won't lower positivity number.
11,230 PCR_tests, 15%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.126).
9494 PCR_tests, 19%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.125).
25%_positive rate, but yeah, nothing to see here - testing plenty.
20,792 PCR_tests (WHOO!), 17%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.126).
[%_positive is still at 14-15%] so let's hold off on that victory lap just yet.
The only data we have right now is awful, it’s a heavily biased stream of tests that are sometimes 30%_positive because we’re testing people who suspect they’ve been exposed.
14104 PCR_tests (WHOO!), 22%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.126).
8732 PCR_tests, 24%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.124).
Red dot is 0%_positive.
In general, percents rarely change large amounts after the 50k test mark, which is why 0%_positive matters so much more than raw numbers for a macro scale.
What I would like to know is if the tests reported (about 8000) is what was done yesterday and how reliable would the 0%_positive vs # cases would be if we are so behind.
Surprisingly competent while simultaneously vague: <5%_positive test rate and...
%_positive peaked the week of June 29th and has decreased every week since.
6315 PCR_tests, 27%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.123).
But if the backlog is 18%_positive then we went from 100K to 150K in 10 days or something.
Instead it's a low number of tests and high 0%_positive.
With 1,690 serology tests reported today, and a serology positive rate of 12.3% from the week of July 12, I'd estimate that about 208 of today's new cases are serology positives, which makes the math (1926-208)/6315 = 27.2%_positive.
14,143 PCR_tests, 24%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.126).
Because I didn't see the job of "COVID testing - Arizona statewide director $14/hour" on Craigslist, I'm 100%_positive they took this into account.
We are shrinking our sample size but our 0%_positive is as high as ever.
The gov's office is going to utilize incomplete numbers as some bullshit way to say "we are seeing a downward trend."  They continually skip over the 0%_positive cases and only use total cases as their talking point as its a number that just looks good on the graph to push the agenda.
7,544 PCR_tests, 19%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.126).
%_positive is still crazy high, so there is still significant community spread happening even if the raw numbers have dropped off a bit (which we really can’t know for sure since the testing has been an absolute clusterfuck as of late).
i don't think this kind of testing works with 20-30%_positive rate.
13,988 PCR_tests, 15%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.089).
I’d agree that the 0%_positive is flattening, but our cases reported are only flattening because of testing bottlenecks (both administered and analyzed).
We’re around 20%_positive right now.
If we’re doing 35k/day we’d have to be less than 15%_positive to see a decrease in cases reported.
Ticked back *up* to 20%_positive range.
7,836 PCR_tests (Sonora Quest probably swamped and delayed again?), 34%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.087).
30%_positive rate puts AZ as the worst infected rate per capita still.
the ones that did come in are 30%_positive.
As far as the backlog, the 0%_positive is going to be the determining factor there as to whether the new cases per capita can climb past FL, but the very slightly possible positive right now is that the enormous backlog is steadily coming down from its particular peak, so there is a decent chance that the numbers right now are more accurate than they were a week to a week and a half ago.
A little bit of good news is that our percent positive is continuing to drop a bit, now at 19%_positive range.
15,664 PCR_tests, 24%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.087).
Tests I believe are individual tests, the 0%_positive is out of the number of people who have tested.
I went through and read the notes, specifically the one designated with th “**” for 0%_positive.
The 0%_positive, in my opinion will be 88% across the country.
We ticked down to around 19%_positive range.
13,307 PCR_tests, 22%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.084).
At this point I wouldn't be surprised if this fucking asshole reinstituted the ban on mask mandates and opened the state back up 100% just because the numbers leveled off for five days (at 20%_positive with a massive backlog of tests and the likely/potential 4th of July spike still another week away from showing up in the numbers).
We are still around the 20%_positive range.
13,993 PCR_tests, 22%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.078).
I see the reported PCR 0%_positive slowly tick up and I'm like ok Ducey your own website shows things climbing what are you going to do, the ask nicely and watch netflix is obviously not working.
We dipped a little to around the 20%_positive range.
19488 PCR_tests, 21%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.078).

But anyway, based on what we have, it's a 20%_positive rate again.
Past couple of days have been 18%_positive rate (compared to like 24%+ last week).
Today was 21.7%_positive and this morning Trump retweeted Chuck Woolery (??!!) saying that everyone (CDC, media, doctors, Democrats) is lying about Covid to influence the election.
The bar is so low that 21.7%_positive and the pres wearing a mask once in public looks good.
With 11.8%_positive from total tests , so it can get much worse.
12,170 PCR_tests, 20%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.062).
With the lagging test_results, we’re solidly in the 22%_positive range last week.
16,110 PCR_tests, 25%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.064).
What are your thoughts about your 0%_positive graphs?
The insane thing is that if we were reporting out 35k instead of 16k, without even one more positive result, we would still have a nearly 12%_positive rate right now.
We could get to 100%_positive tests for 7 days and the spin would be "Percentages have plateaued for the past week, and we expect them to not go any higher, that's a good thing"
The failure has been so bad this week that I got kind of excited about only 25%_positive on 16k tests.
With the lagging test_results, we’re solidly in the 22%_positive range from two weeks ago.
14,765 PCR_tests, 19%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.062).
WH task force said yesterday that the "positivity rate was flattening" in an attempt to make 30%_positives look good.
I’ve added the overall 0%_positive graphs back onto my spreadsheet (total reported daily cases by AZDHS include both PCR &.
With the lagging test_results, we’re solidly in the **22%_positive range last week**.
11,931 PCR_tests, 33%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.065).
We hit 33%_positive on today's report.
With the lagging test_results, we’re nearing 22%_positive on cases from last week.
12,212 PCR_tests, 27%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.065).
Problem is, pool testing only works with lower 0%_positive rates.
With the lagging test_results, we’re holding steady at 21%_positive on cases from two weeks ago.
I thought the running 0%_positive is based on total cases reported today divided by total tests reported today.
And at likely 20-25%_positive on the low end, that means 16-20k cases.
13,459 PCR_tests, 25%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.05).
14,844 PCR_tests, 23%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.05).
With the lagging test_results, we’ve now bumped up to 21%_positive on cases from last week’s tests.
11,121 PCR_tests, 19%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (serology tests \* 0.05).
March was all under 20k tests a day, and April was almost all under 30K tests per day, and were getting 40-50%_positive.
at a 40%_positive, you're looking at 8K positive on 20K tests - which means AZ still has room to double.
11,235 PCR_tests, 29%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (today's serology tests \* 0.05).
17,535 PCR_tests, 25%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives (today's serology tests \* 0.05).
Went from 1.8 percent positive to 7%_positive in less than a week, and that is with going from 5000 tests/day to 7000- 10,000 tests/day.
I don't get the fixation on number of tests, or even 0%_positive.
17,227 PCR_tests, 28%_positive rate after deducting a guesstimate for serology positives.
Also, 28%_positive rate today.
The last two days reported about 25k PCR_tests, with a ~20%_positive rate.
Since today’s testing numbers were so low, it looks like we have a very large 0%_positive.
DON’T FREAKOUT if today’s 0%_positive is abnormally high and tomorrow’s number of cases is way higher than normal.
And yet ours still won't despite having double the 0%_positive tests that AZ and FL have.
Arizona mixes in serology in the total 0%_positive for some stupid reason.
If we had used those tests on the people who are most likely to have it we’ve been getting a 20%_positive rate and we’d successfully find about 1,000 cases with those tests.
Also our 0%_positive is much higher than any other state showing we are likely undercounting worse than anywhere.
Maricopa had a 27.7%_positive rate today! I think we can safely say that the number of reported cases doesn’t represent anything close to the actual number.
- Total 0%_positive all tests: 9.4%
- Total 0%_positive PCR_tests: 11.4%
- Total 0%_positive serology tests: 3.1%
For the weekly 0%_positive PCR specific updates the dashboard says this:
Our overall 0%_positive should be 10.7% not 9.4%
The 0%_positive is gradually going up.
20%_positive as of June 14th and the latest numbers not posted yet.
22%_positive.
Texas is closing shit down because they’ve reached 10%_positives.
On that tab, I see total PCR_tests, tests reported yesterday, overall 0%_positive, tests by county, tests by collection date, tests by age group, weekly tests, and weekly aggregate 0%positive.
The 0%_positive for PCR_tests matches up with each individual day’s total(?) cases divided by PCR_tests done.
Then the percent positive will show like 75%_positive.
When we opened op in May, we were way down around 5%_positive.
Plus currently hovering around a 20%_positive test rate.
**We have gone from 5%_positive cases a month ago to around 17% now**.
That's over 21%_positive.
That 23.8%_positive rate is downright alarming.
At a 15%_positive rate, it will be them or someone close to them.
Weekly PCR_tests are up to 15%_positive so far this week.
Arizona has been conducting an antibody study and so far the results are not promising - a little over 2%_positive.
Sure, if you are only testing 100 people and get a 6%_positive, that is 6 people, if you test 1,000 that 6% would be 60 people, yes more testing would result in higher numbers if the positive 0% was stable, or even decreased.
In fact, as testing increasing you would expect the 0%_positive to decrease if everything was holding steady.
Every day the PCR 0%_positive is climbing from 6 to 7 to now 8 but then you always say this average that seems much higher.
If this whole weak posit of "we have more cases because we have so much more testing" then the 0%_positives should be going down, but instead it's increasing.
Christ) Continue to monitor, increase in 0%_positive.
Lot of testing going on, increase in cases, higher 0%_positive as tests return.
Why is it 7.7%_positive for the day but 14% for the week?
If you look at the lab testing page, 0%_positive for the week ps ending 4/24 and 5/31 are both 8%_positive.
From what I’m seeing on their website, if we are using the 0%_positive of PCR_tests as our metric, then that hit a low the weeks of May 3rd and May 10th at 5%.
The 0%_positive rates have been lower, but hospitalizations, ER visits, and even the 7 day new case average has been trending up.
As such, if someone got both tests and returned a positive on one or another, that would be a 50%_positive for that person.
The 0%_positive is trending down.
cases went up, but 0%_positive fell...
they now have cases lowering, but 0%_positive jumping...
The state is using 0%_positive to judge prevalence, so last week would actually be the first week in a few weeks that it has gone *up*, by their standards.
Whatever day those results come back will probably show a spike in 0%_positive.
As of today’s reporting they are showing 6.7%_positive PCR of 245,486 Total tests = 16,448, or to go to the bottom of the range of rounding error 6.65% of 245,486 is 16,325 on the bottom side, still above the total cases reported of 15!608.
6.7%_positive PCR of 245,486 Total tests = 16,448.
3.0%_positive serology of 245,486 Total tests = 7,365.
That 6.7%_positive was for the day.
y-axis = 0%_positive.
PCR 127,750 tests * 7.4%_positives = 9,454.
11,736 cases/159,082 tests = 7.4% not the reported 6.5%_positive.
PCR 122,842 tests * 7.5%_positives = 9,213.
Serology 36,209 tests * 3.2%_positives = 1,159.
Edit: with 101,125 total PCR_tests, and 10,526 positives, my math of 10,526/101,125 is 10.4%_positive.
Seems to follow a narrative to meet the <10%_positive goal so we can open back up.
Az is at 30%_positive test rate now.
What’s still alarming to me is our 17.2%_positive rate is up there with really affected regions like wa and nyc.
AZ: 12.6%_positive.
NY: 18.6%_positive.
WA: 16.9%_positive.
CA: 9.5%_positive.
FL: 13.3%_positive.
For the week of June 14-20,  the average number of daily tests is roughly the same (actually slightly less, 27,268), but the 0%_positive rate jumps to 11.08%.
And, so far this week (starting June 21), the average daily number of tests goes up to  31,906, and the average 0%_positive rate is 13.79%.
staying right at about 10%_positive no matter how many they test, 13k tests Saturday 1200 new.
No matter how much testing is happening, florida stays at exactly 10%_positive test rate.
So we ended up talking about the 0%_positive rate, how it's exceeding the increase in testing, etc.
Or the 0%_positive in ICU -- skeptics like to point out that they count every positive and report as if they were all there for COVID-19, when some are there for other reasons and happen to have COVID-19.
Since they are across the border from Reynosa, they have Mexican nationals coming over (because the situation in Mexico is infinitely worse with almost no testing and a 50%_positive rate, that's what it was in NYC at the peak), and the facilities on this side of the border do not turn anyone away as long as they have room.
Mexico has over 40%_positive on tests.
The 7 day rolling average of 0%_positive is at an all time high of 16.8%.
For context, Florida's 0%_positive for their 15,299 day was 11.25%.
100%_positive Mike Pence (61) is in charge of the Coronavirus Task Force and Kushner isn't on it.
I'm curious about 0%_positives here and why there was such a massive jump and if this is a new, awful trend...
Adequate testing btw, to me means copying Taiwan, which is <1%_positive to negative ratio.
...meaning they are running out of tests, and the 0%_positive of the tests they currently have is climbing.
A rate above 5%_positive is supposed to be a red flag that there aren't enough tests.
The latest number I saw was that people in Texas were testing at a 12%_positive rate.
Really your concern should be 0%_positive.
As a comparison, MN is averaging around 3%_positive.
Travis County only did just over 400 tests today too apparently and had almost 30%_positive rate, giving 129 new cases which is scary...
Atm, the 7 day moving average for 0%_positive in Texas is 9.51%.
~17%_positive per Dallas Morning News.
21%_positives is the latest number I’ve seen for North Texas.
%_positive and number of hospitalizations are the best indicators for your area.
%_positive has gone up a lot.
If it was, 0%_positive would be the same.
No it really doesn't explain a spike in 0%_positives rising.
The big thing with the test rate is I have been watching which counties are above that 10%_positive rate to show they are not testing the right population.
Then the first week or two in May it ranged from 4.5%_positive rate to 10% on 5/9, but since then the positive rate started decreasing.
Non-diagnostic tests made it seem like diagnostic testing was higher than it actually was, and made 0%_positive seem lower than it actually was.
The first two corrected days jumped 0%_positive up about half of a 0%.
that starts with how many tests, and what 0%_positive?
well that means # of tests looks higher and 0%_positive looks lower.
Testing volume and 0%_positive are important things to watch, are benchmarks for reopening, and had been off the mark by the inclusion of the 49k antibody_tests.
%_positive is down!
Well obviously its value is to show increased testing (of the wrong data), counterbalance rises in cases (with lowering 0%_positive), and to sway minds away from caution and back to business/life as usual.
With all the false_positives it will drive up the absolute number of positives, but it's very likely to also drive down the 0%_positive against total tests administered.
I certainly haven't seen any downward trends in any metric except 0%_positives.
(positivity rate is manufacture in that we've opened up testing criteria so drastically since we started this that the 0%_positive rate going down is meaningless).
The concern is that low 0%_positive can be inflated by doing a lot of antibody_testing, or double-test the same people.
Upstate NY only had a 4%_positive rate.
If we can test and contact trace enough, these soft openings might yield us a Rt lower than 1 (like SK) so hopefully we are getting testing up there and reducing our 0%_positive from tests.
%_positive basically flat, testing increasing:
According to the CDC, WHO, and a bunch of other smart people you want to be testing at less than a 10%_positive rate per day to show you are testing the right population.
According to the WHO, CDC, and other super smart people you need to be at a 10%_positive rate to know you are testing the correct population.
New: 12,176 10.3%_positive.
Past 7: 108,646 6.8%_positive.
Overall: 489,289 7.7%_positive.
Angelina and Polks health dept is reporting 15.5%_positive for Angelina and Polk is reporting 18.8%_positive.
Harris - 10.2%_positive.
Bexar - 13%_positive.
Brazos - 13.4%_positive
Cameron - 14.2%_positive.
Dallas - 13.4%_positive.
El Paso - 14%_positive.
Lubbock - 15%_positive.
Tarrant - 13.2%_positive.
Travis - 13.5%_positive.
Also it was reported that Abbott's metric was of all testing if it goes above 7%_positive he may consider rolling back the reopen, it's currently at like 4% or below.
I can only imagine that once we run over 30k tests we will see a 3.x%_positive rate for a day.
We are throwing the largest net we have ever thrown and we are catching a smaller 0%_positive every day.
Our goal is to remain under 7.5%_positive rate per day which we have done every single day with the increased testing minus the numbers from Sunday.
If you increase testing and relax testing criteria to include people without symptoms, and have a lockdown for several weeks, well its likely your 0%_positive will go down, don't ya think?
5.2%_positive rate for our 20th day below the current average of 7.8%.
Like the numbers the state released today show a 3%_positive rate.
Many states, including Texas, have seen 2-3 weeks of stagnating growth numbers (outside of our recent 2-3 day spike which still doesn't represent alarming growth numbers with it only getting back to a 10%_positive rate with the spike).
The 0%_positive rate was not doubling (it was flat), so the actual number of cases were not doubling.
We performed over 100K tests over the last week and because of that we had a decrease in the 0% that test positive (was hovering around a 10%_positive rate, down now to about an 8%_positive rate).
If Texas had a serious outbreak of infected (like NY, NJ) we wouldn't see a decline in 0%_positive when more tests are performed similar to what happened in CA when they started performing more tests.
About 8%_positive testing rate.
We tested fewer, found more 0%_positive and were growing at a faster rate.
If we get to the point where we're testing randos with no symptoms, then yes, the meaning of 0%_positive starts to change.
But if we're just testing more people with the same criteria, then even if cases double, 0%_positive still remains the most important metric.
Yep, I agree that changing criteria for the tests makes the 0%_positive a less valuable metric.
The numbers show it, the fewer we test the more 0%_positive we find.
We ran 20k tests one day last week and had a 4.6%_positive rate.
Also, do you have a link for the epidemiologists saying we need to be at a 1%_positive rate?
Both states were at about a 10%_positive rate until CA boosted testing over the last week.
Now CA is at about a 5%_positive rate, and TX is still around 10% which shows the outbreak in TX is under control.
For comparisons sake, NY is about 40%_positive rate, so NY is the state that really needs to test heavily along with a couple other countries up in the NE.
But I can say for sure, Texas has been at a 10%_positive rate for weeks, if not more than a month....
~~Bexar County has 12.8%_positive test rate.~~
~~Dallas County has 18.5%_positive test rate.~~
~~Harris County has 24.7%_positive test rate.~~
Texas as a state continues to sit at around 10%_positive rate, which experts define as case containment...
We're at about 11%_positive which should mean we are approaching an adequate level of testing.
In places where there is what the US experts consider "sufficient testing" (and their standards are not very high), there is expected to be 10%_positives/90% negatives.
In New York, at the beginning, they were seeing 90%_positives because their 0% of infected was much higher.
Texas is sitting at almost exactly 10%_positive.
California is sitting at 13% - their testing is actually less aggressive than Texas; New Jersey is over 55%, and New York is at 40%_positive- they are still playing massive catch-up.
Texas ranks 39th in Cases per 100k with 38.65 (a 10.56%_positive rate) and 42nd in Deaths per 100k with 0.72 (a 1.87% mortality rate).
(My own test was done in my doctors' parking lot with no one ahead of me.) The low 10%_positive rate for the tests that have been done in Texas is a good sign; that's about half the 20%_positive rate for the country as a whole.
That’s the reason I’m looking at the 0%_positive - because it cuts thru the confounding factors - including the ones you are concerned about.
To me that sounds like more reasons NOT to look at 11k positives, 110k total tests and conclude, "welp, only 10%_positive, time to open everything up again!"
currently we are at an 8%_positive rate..
In areas like NY they are getting a 40-50%_positive rate.
Louisiana is at about a 21%_positive rate..
I suspect they are counting the pending in the total, my reasoning for that is that statewide we are at a little less than 10%_positive, but somewhere like Dallas is reporting negative and positive together is at around 22%_positive.
He takes into account the 0%_positive tests.
Texas: 47,857 tested, 3997 positive, 8.35%_positive.
That makes it almost 13%_positive rate.
That’s definitely true, but places like New York are coming back 35-40%_positive.
It has around 30%_positive tests, If they tested around 29 a day in Houston since around 3/5 or 3/6, seems like it’s about 10-20% accuracy rate.
Jesus, 66%_positive.
THAT'S 15%_positive, PEOPLE.
I'm going to be the pessimist and suggest that we plateau at higher per capita rates than the Northeast's plateau which came after a hard lockdown.
With open state borders and no short term real lockdown, there is no way this doesn’t blow up upon relaxing restrictions.
Disclaimer: I'm in favor of full lockdown.
And they had weeks of hard lockdown to decrease the number of infectious people whereas we have not.
An Australian state just declared emergency lockdown over 600 cases!
She’s the one who suggested that anti-lockdown protestors at the state capitol should cosplay as medical workers:
You're fine with your rambling 🙆‍♀️ I'm admittedly over people stating that staying home is the safest place to be, without realizing that unless there's another lockdown, people like me still need to work out in public in order to have income, health insurance, and our jobs once the world is less contagious.
We have a friend in law enforcement who we haven’t seen since the start of lockdown because they’ve behaved similarly.
"Is it possible to stabilize coronavirus infections without going into full lockdown?
The question now is whether it is possible to do so while avoiding another full lockdown, and states like Arizona are offering a real-time experiment.
One notable outlier is California, which was the first state to issue a stay-at-home order and where a spring lockdown lasted longer than those in many other states.
Basically we need a lockdown until we can hit 10% positivity then open in phases like CA tried to do, but again 100% mask mandate would have to be part of the deal.
Been here about a month and slowly watching people do what we did in AZ - get lockdown fatigue and go out, but masks are required and have been since they locked down.
Ducey, with a local majority of your residents calling for the necessity of another lockdown or at minimum, statewide face_mask requirements, why haven't we seen these simple measures yet?
For example, if our lives were top priority, why are we not mandating masks, or even in continued lockdown?
Another full lockdown wouldn't work again.
u/nicolegriggabc15 I second the “how many more deaths will it take for you to issue a lockdown.” What’s the number, where’s the line in the sand?
No lockdowns, no assistance, our governor is spouting we’re ‘in the green’ our own president said we had the best (lowest) death rate  (we don’t) it feels like they’re saying our tremendous loss doesn’t even matter..
Anyways, I know that without a universal lockdown, there’s the incentive for businesses to stay open because of competitive reasons (and I’m not excusing their greed).
I was saying more that I don’t get why businesses in general aren’t lobbying the government for a more universal lockdown that puts the competitive logic of the market “on ice” so to speak.
Hoping for the best, but our government just extended our lockdown yesterday.
Notably, this doesn't increase the time in lockdown, it increases the number of people getting sick at once, increasing the risk of hospitals overflowing, increasing lethality rate.
This actually decreases the time to get to herd immunity, decreasing the time in lockdown.
But as someone who is immunocompromised and yet forced to work I was already scared through the lockdown...but now that my girlfriend is working and my roommates I’m even more scared.
I don't think there will be another lockdown.
You've been in lockdown for the last 2 months.
Your life may not have been affected much by all this, but there are real people whos lives were completely destroyed by these lockdowns.
The lockdowns have FUCKED the economy.
Even if there is another “spike” in cases, another lockdown will not be tolerated.
We cant let the government put us in prison fuck it cant stay in lockdown for ever.
I’m not saying we shouldn’t use precautions because we should, but when you look at numbers, this is why many people feel that the lockdown needs to end.
The problem is it's not only "lockdown" or "not lockdown." It's not binary, it's a scale.
It will have to get really ugly for them to accept that it's bad enough to warrant another lockdown.
I would pull my hair out if I didn’t cut it extremely short myself because I can’t risk going out! I can overhear my uncle talking about how he bailed on getting a covid test today because the line was so long (which seems to confirm the idea that republicans think the testing bottleneck is working in their favor...) and now he and my dad are talking about how there is no science to back up masks and Democrats just like lockdowns because the bad economy makes Trump look bad.
The anti-lockdown crowd (lobby?) seems pretty small.
Our lockdown was also a half-measure since almost everyone was an "essential worker"
There many reasons why they are horribly dystopian, and it's been explained on the other anti lockdown subs numerous times.
Unfortunately, leadership in arizona is majorly lacking which will make what could have been the worst part of a lockdown beyond as bad as it should’ve ever been.
We wasted the months that the lockdown bought us.
You do a full lockdown to get the cases to a manageable place.
Coming out of lockdown, AZ should have had almost zero cases - we entered at a completely manageable case count...
during our “lockdown” case counts should *not* have been climbing - although I do give them the benefit of the doubt that testing was partially responsible for this.
However, we barely had our R below 1 because our lockdown was almost non existent.
If we implement another lockdown but those two activities take place, I highly doubt we will fall much below 1, if at all.
Look how many businesses and people are defiant as it is without a lockdown.
Can we rise up and do ANYTHING to make a lockdown happen?
I'm certain she wanted a full and complete lockdown, but Dumbass wouldn't budge, they put the screws to her, and rather than compromise her morality and oath by going along with the plan, she resigned.
He said over and over that before the lockdown was lifted we were doing great, and it exploded after.
Like, *he even went out of his way* to show how much the initial lockdown helped.
He literally just sat here and explained to us for a half hour how the lockdown worked and worked well.
He even had *graphs made* to show how good the lockdown worked and how, after the lockdown was lifted, how cases and deaths shot through the roof.
How the fuck is he thinking anything other than another lockdown (and a harsher one at that, sorry golf courses...
He's walking us into a lockdown a bit at a time every 2 weeks.
He's toying with my emotions..he's make comments like he is setting the stage for a lockdown but then makes comments that detract from that.
Im unsure about flying—but ive been all over the National Parks of our State since lockdown.
Just this over the past few weeks  Ive been to both the North & South rim of the Grand Canyon, Prescotts Watson & Lynx’s lakes, and earlier in lockdown I went to Patagonia.
This is such a political battle that another lockdown I think is far fetched.
The lockdown is out of our hands and pretty unlikely, so do your best to control what you can control.
Another lockdown won’t fly.
I also believe that there will be an inevitable lockdown.
The overly optimistic approach I've seen in the state kinda just makes a lockdown seem inevitable.
I also have the same timeline as you: by the end of the month I'm expect some sort of lockdown.
A bunch of people have died and their economy is barely slightly better compared to some of the places that did lockdowns.
Went to Phoenix (live in Yuma) after the lockdown ended.
I'd much rather just do a full lockdown but if we have to do half measures let's just keep restaurants take out only and let gyms be open.
Again I'd much rather just do a full lockdown than a half assed lockdown tho.
4x/week gym go-er before lockdown.
Arizona opened with no “phases.” Restaurant dining rooms were packed as soon as lockdown was over.
When the pandemic hit the US, the whole country basically went on lockdown for 1-2 months.
We opened really early but took the lockdown extremely seriously.
There was never a lockdown.
I think the difference compared to other states is mostly due to A) particularly weak post lockdown regulations B) the whole running around from air conditioned building to air conditioned building thing.
Plus between lockdowns and everything seems anything except off the beaten path has been on amateur mode holiday weekend crowds.
The first one got it back in March before the lockdown.
Hi there I just want to rant because I’m very annoyed - my partner, who I live with, and myself have been super careful since the pandemic/lockdown started.
Thank you! It pisses me off extra because I know there are so many people people, like us, who have been safe & responsible this whole time and yet we’re are likely to have another lockdown because of the people who don’t give a f*ck.
As much as I don’t want another lockdown I fear it’s our only option and delaying it costs precious lives..
They are in before the lockdown.
I’m just terrified that hyper partisan judges will completely strike down any lockdown like they did in Wisconsin....
A second lockdown is being discussed by them from what I am told.
closing bars is about where we were during lockdown, so honestly, not the worst idea...
A lockdown like Michigan or NYs didn't make sense for AZ in March or April.
Say what you will but it's what gave us this and the protesters of the lockdowns and the protesters of racial injustice and police brutality to go out and risk it.
Every other place (state/country) enacted strict lockdowns when it got to this point.
why isn’t Maricopa back under lockdown?
Also, this is what that dumbass sent out the first lockdown.
They have more hand_sanitizer dispensers than pre-lockdown and they only let you use every other cardio machine.
People didn’t follow the lockdown guidelines they won’t follow this unless we show it’s more than empty words.
In my opinion to exist from this situation Arizona needs one month (With or without lockdown).
The virus can stay in the body for three months, for this reason in my opinion is not correct to start the lockdown but is correct force the people to following the rules inside the country and in the world.
To be clear I’m not suggesting we go back into total lockdown; simply close bars and clubs and restrict restaurants to take out or reduce capacity further.
Yes, I do agree that Az should go into another lockdown.
Ducey is terrified of the most extreme arm of the Right, so I would be straight up shocked if he initiated another lockdown no matter how bad this gets.
2) in the middle to long term, those who lockdown are better off economically.
The issue here isn't whether a "full lockdown" would have helped more.
Had they done THAT, there would have been no need for any lockdown at all.
China did a scorched-earth lockdown.
To get a zero case count would of required the entire country, not just states, to do a full lockdown and then to basically close borders with anyone who also is suspected of having cases.
Then lockdown locally anytime you see community spread somewhere.
The goal of a lockdown would be to reduce R so that caught cases are nonexistent or that R is significantly less than 1.
I was advocating for debt freeze (ALL debt - mortgage, rent, corporate) for the time of a real lockdown...
We could be almost open by now if we did a real lockdown.
Or, you know, a federal government that DIDN'T spend trillions on everything BUT the people during the "lockdown" might have been the better move...
But I can say that ar the moment the virus are in the main fases, also if the Arizona start the lockdown now the cases will increase.
Also, the italy with lockdown don't stopped the virus because now are increasing again.
with lockdown the virus are only in delay.
I remember reading an article positing that one of the reasons Florida didn’t blow up (at that time) despite having no lockdown and so many people from NY was that their housing wasn’t as dominated by apartments and public transit.
Good luck getting law enforcement to enforce mask or lockdown regulations, even if the government enacts some reasonable rules that don't have a massive number of loopholes.
We needed a second lockdown like, two weeks ago.
He wanted to take us somewhere special to celebrate the lockdown being lifted, so he decided on Olive Garden.
We had one of the sheriffs who refused to enforce the prior “lockdown.”
I'm sad to say, but I don't think there is anything that will convince Doug to do another lockdown.
As much as I’d like to see a lockdown, I don’t see Ducey doing this.
As much as I want a second lockdown, I don't know if that's the answer-just hear me out.
Doing nothing (no lockdown) is obviously not a good idea, because it will make the virus spread more-and turn us into New York.
But on the other hand, another lockdown, with people in isolation for months on end isn't a good idea either.
I do think there is a point of deaths that a lockdown becomes forced on him but sadly it looks like that’s the only thing that will happen.
At the rate we're going, without a lockdown I'm afraid we won't ever see the end of all this suffering and insane amount of cases until there's vaccine- that is, if the vaccine is distributed to everyone and is funded so people who can't afford it can still get it.
I'm hoping with all my being that AZ enforces another lockdown and mask wearing everywhere, ACTUALLY enforces it.
We needed another lockdown weeks ago.
Cool, sure, but shows they clearly still have no plan :(We need to have a lockdown now to prevent more hospitals being overrun.
Maybe if we had enforced masks and distancing, etc., earlier, there wouldn't be a need for a second lockdown.
Notice they didn't do anything of the sort to the lockdown protests and all of the Karens at capitol hill screaming about their rights?
Right, I do wonder though how much the general public would support another lockdown.
Unfortunately, the lockdown we had and all that was sacrificed during that time was squandered by a bunch of selfish individuals that had to go party and live it up.
Now it’s mid-June, so we’re seeing the spike from the people who may not have rushed out the second the lockdown was over, but waited a couple weeks after.
If we had adequate testing at that time, the lockdown would not have been necessary.
They went on a total lockdown and were able to reopen....without a vaccine.
Then he doubled down and said even after all of this he wouldn't change anything, including not enforcing the original lockdown.
I think that the people have spoken loudly, and even if they're fucking stupid, they're against lockdowns and masks, and now we have an ugly compromise.
If we lockdown, people are going to just fight it harder.
It's not a "lockdown" - it's more of a "targeted lockdown".
But with so much goodwill run dry after the previous lockdown, do you think people will follow another one?
Arizona went into lockdown way too early and now people take it as a joke.
I think that once we start piling bodies of family members into refrigerated trucks, attitudes towards lockdown will change.
So people wanted that lockdown because we were scared shitless.
I don't really think we went into lockdown too early.
But I do think that had Arizona held-off for perhaps 6-12 weeks (or instituted test-driven targeted lockdowns, like South Korea), our numbers would have probably been about the same.
Of course, it doesn’t help that businesses are now operating essentially the same way that they did pre-lockdown and that our governor has told us that we just need to learn to live with this reality.
If we aren’t going to do another lockdown, I hope that at least some of the mandatory mask mandates coming down the line will help at least a little.
Even if a perfect lockdown occurred there are at least two weeks of doubling each week to come.
The issue isn't a proper or not proper lockdown in March.
My 60+ year old relatives and all of their friends have been hitting the bars nonstop since lockdown ended because they think this is a all hoax and they’ll be fine if they get sick.
Letting the situation get worse only prolongs how long restaurants and other places will have to operate at reduced capacity (and almost nobody is profitable when your stores can only be half or 2/3 full), and will suppress consumer demand regardless of lockdown measures because people won’t feel safe going out to spend money.
For what it’s worth, I’ve heard no chance in hell for another lockdown - but I assume that hospital beds being past surge and field hospital capacity would force their hand.
Those anti-lockdown morons also had the same excuses.
You had hundreds of morons that would show up with guns to protest the lockdown.
Just like the anti-lockdown protesters felt their cause was...
I doubt we’ll ever see another lockdown, even if we have a higher spike than them!
I’m on lockdown at home but I’m driving to Northern California to my parents house and stay safe with them.
I often wonder what else governments or authorities can do outside of a return to lockdown and requiring masks.
(That's NOT an anti-lockdown talking point, because even as hard as it's been, I still I am very aware that this needs to get under control and that's the only way to really do it, as impossible as it is in AZ ever again).
This is what anti-lockdown people don't get.
Every time I went to the grocery in Phoenix during lockdown, masks were widespread and I didn’t see anybody gathering in public places.
This shitstain actively tried to sabotage the state's lockdown efforts, and when he got sick — he still gets the same spot in line for a ventilator as the rest of us.
The article explains which lockdown restrictions he refused to enforce.
With that clearly not happening, masks being required in many places now, casinos and other businesses going back into lockdown I hope and suspect that schools are taking another look now too.
Have a strict lockdown?
I have been critical of anti maskers and our state's "lockdown" but I can ask questions to anything I see that doesn't add up.
If we were to keep the lockdown longer than may 15 it's obviously too late.
[If this passes it will have loopholes and the state will make all sorts of exceptions as they did with lockdown and curfew].
How can someone refuse to enforce lockdown orders - then catch the virus by hosting a rally - spread the infection to hundreds of people without masks  at that rally -  not mandate masks?
It’s not the government that needs to help, you’re never going to be able to lockdown any place in the us and still keep your job as a politician.
We are still in lockdown here, which I'm thankful for.
IIRC, even after the lockdown in Italy and NYC, it took them months before things finally started to slow down.
If this passes it will have loopholes and the state will make all sorts of exceptions as they did with lockdown and curfew.
I have the bad feeling that AZ is at a point where if we were to total lockdown now we will still overload the hospitals.
I stopped trying because they live in India and India is enforcing very strict lockdown rules.
Face it, the lockdowns are over, regardless of what happens with covid.
I know we’re not New York, but they ended up with 300k+ cases in a short time period, and cases continued to happen even after a lockdown that was more strict than anything we have ever done.
The last lockdown was mostly squandered anyway.
I remember back, over a month ago, when there were people attending the anti-lockdown protests.
Those anti-lockdown protests were rather small and isolated.
Those protests have been much larger than the anti-lockdown protests, and have been occurring on a daily basis.
But can we admit just like this curfew, the lockdown was not a really a lockdown?
We weren’t texting enough to make a difference, still aren’t so things will get way worse after the lockdown protests, the police protests and general covid fatigue, things are gonna get ugly.
Except none of the "bad" stuff is actually happening anywhere that has lifted lockdowns.
lol, but the general AZ public have not even been staying safe since the lockdown began, hence our steadily rising numbers even though we were in lockdown.
I’m affected by the people in my household who are getting restless with lockdown.
What you described is *not* flattening the curve, it's using a lockdown as a delay tactic.
Brown’s lockdown, which was “all non-essential businesses to be closed”.
Just a reminder that the lockdown was not to PREVENT the spread.
A lockdown will not and cannot prevent people from getting Covid.
9 day old account no email, maybe you're anti-lockdown agitator.
We'll see how many weeks we last before another lockdown.
A good move was he said if numbers increased, we'd go into a full lockdown.
Okay, 8 day old account that only posts anti-lockdown responses.
As I have mentioned, I am not anti-lockdown.
Maybe you need to dial back a little and consider how long a lockdown can really go on.
If we get a 2nd lockdown, people are going to need some cash.
Hi I’m not at all against the lockdown.
This lockdown is unnecessary!!! It’s hurting the economy!!!!
Again I’m not at all anti- lockdown.
I can *barely* swing it to combat this salary slash because I’ve been saving and scrimping, but I don’t have enough to last through a second lockdown.
uhm, the first lockdowns already got us at unemployment rates unseen sicne the great depression.
Maybe it drops again once we hit a 2nd wave/lockdown/whatever.
We haven't been growing linearly, even with lockdown.
Trump’s brief visit is his first away from the East Coast since the coronavirus lockdown went into effect.
A restaurant re-opened in Maine recently despite the lockdown, so the state revoked their Health Safety License, he's staying open despite being fined everyday for operating without a license, he'll be broke soon.
Just the locking down pushes off the inevitable if there's no vaccine by the time you end lockdowns.
Realistically, there's not gonna be a 1 year lockdown until there's a vaccine cleared and produce.
Lockdown until a vaccine comes or treatment.
End lockdown no restrictions.
End lockdown with guidelines, allow young and healthy to go back out.
If you're elderly or immune comprised continue to lockdown to the extend feasible.
But other options are unrealistic in that you can't lockdown indefinitely.
UN just came out with a report that millions could strave in the 3rd world as a result of lockdowns.
It is not feasible, for more reasons than I can list, to lockdown for year plus until a vaccine is cleared and put in production.
They will have herd immunity while we come out of lockdown without millions of vaccines ready our plan of artificial herd immunity.
Lockdowns are fine in the short term in order to get data and a handle on the situation.
This can't all be political rhetoric, it has to be code for "I am an average American and don't have $500 to cover an unexpected expense, let alone a couple months of lockdown."
Um what have we been doing with lockdowns and isolation if not controlling the spread of the virus?
Just like we were never in a full lockdown, being in slightly less of a lockdown is possible.
Who needs to get new eyelashes put in when you are on lockdown?
I start my travel into 29 February and the lockdown in Italy started the next week, there was a lot of superficialities about virus, some people how me, I was very worried and other people with impolite behavior to the people worried.
A statistical analysis by Setti’s team suggests higher levels of particle pollution could explain higher rates of infection in parts of northern Italy before a lockdown was imposed, an idea supported by another preliminary analysis.
I was diagnosed with it shortly before everything went on lockdown.
Does this pretty much seal the fate of the anti-lockdown morons?
This causes more cases and would you look at that, we don’t hit the requirements to lift lockdown.
No country or subarea in a country - not even Wuhan - is going to stay on lockdown until a vaccine is found - which is why testing programs are important.
A lockdown is necessary to get cases back to the point where contact tracing is feasible and to build up such a system.
So while the idiots out partying aren't helping us get out of lockdown sooner, they will only be able to super-spread for just so long before they're spooked into compliance or the virus makes them comply.
Ironically, noncompliance gives states that don't have robust testing systems political cover to extend lockdowns/SAH orders.
I'm not advocating for not following social_distance protocols - I'm saying without contact tracing they're meaningless once we exit lockdown.
I was in denial for weeks, obsessively keeping an eye on things over there and maybe for that reason I’ve been so active here on the importance of staying in, but just seeing how a lot of places are truly in lockdown and we are still just politely asking people to please stay at home is frustrating.
I thought the lockdowns were created to allow hospitals to have enough supplies, which looks like the demand is less than supply, so it’s successful.
Do you think the purpose of the lockdown should be reasonably changed to wait for the virus to dissipate more?
But I think at minimum the lockdown should last another month.
People do need the government to listen to the experts and have a lockdown.
Part of me wants a complete lockdown long enough to eliminate the threat.
There's a certain percentage of people (0.1%) that have enough wealth hoarded to tide us (99.9%) over during a complete lockdown.
Idk how it is in Maricopa county but it seems to me like there are more people out and about now than before the lockdown.
Yes some stores are doing the whole 6 ft thing but what about out of them people are still out our list of essential business include everything that was already open and since it's all open people will flock to whatever is open stores are packed (where I'm at it's common to see aisles packed) and just because there is a a lockdown because of this essential list employers will mandate their employees to go to work
Mexico held off on harsh lockdown measures to allow citizens to work a few more weeks.
If they put the state in a complete lockdown will that stop you from going to the ATM?
no place in the states seems to be on full lockdown mode like other parts of the world.
It's not remotely close to a "lockdown"
Unless there is a full block lockdown nationwide, nothing is going to happen to flatten the curve.
We can only hope lockdown is soon.
I’m in lockdown in another state but my husband is at our home with my “hobby room”.
AZ needs a lockdown.
Whether that be a state-wide lockdown or one of their family members gets sick and dies.
We also have been deemed essential and will continue to work through the lockdown so I'm feeling like im playing a game of Corona virus musical chairs.
Wishing for a lockdown now so truly things that can wait will wait!
Lockdown won't do shit.
Well, I guess we'll have to have someone enforce the lockdowns.
Our state is well past the point where Italy imposed their lockdown.
Maybe it's time to lockdown a bit.
Kept an eye on the mainstream media - who completely ignored the fact that 7 million people in China were on lockdown - while I gathered my supplies & packed.
I wish we'd just go on lockdown already.
And Ducey doesn’t want a lockdown because we have so few cases.
Experts agree that a several week lockdown is the best way to avoid many unnecessary deaths AND ALSO to put this behind us SOONER rather than having this drag out.
Why can't we have a statewide lockdown for 2 weeks?
Did ducey actually issue a shelter in place/lockdown order that I'm just not finding in the news?
After seeing this earlier today, I just got into an disagreement today with someone on another subreddit who argued that we shouldn’t go on lockdown because if the economy goes down more people will die but they insisted that I don’t care because I won’t see the potentially astronomical number of deaths caused by that.
Things will probably have to get pretty ugly in Arizona before we see a statewide lockdown.
It’s not a shelter in place/lockdown.
My mistake, the whole state needs a lockdown.
Anyway anyone else think a state by state lockdown will increase this week I think that our case count will reach Italy by wed but fortunately our death rate is nowhere near there's.
The fact that her home county in California is in lockdown.
lets get this lockdown started and over with.
We need a lockdown, but I don’t see that order coming from the governor.
I heard rumblings of a lockdown tomorrow.
I wrote an email to President Trump yesterday voicing my concerns about not being on lockdown.
It's gonna be 3-4 weeks (maybe longer) after we implement a full lockdown til things start to wane.
Heard from somebody in the military that nationwide lockdown could happen Sunday.
During this lockdown police and military are going to drive the streets.
I am hearing rumors of lockdown as early as next week here.
Our take is that lockdown is coming folks.
May start with curfew and end with full lockdown.
So what's the lockdown situation?
Assisted Living Centers and some Retirement communities on lockdown.
As much as I think we need a quarantine, I’ve been seriously disappointed by Arizona’s lack of leadership in this whole situation, and I don’t anticipate any mandated lockdowns or social_distancing policies anytime soon.
Put the country on lockdown at this point...
But I agree to all this and the fact that many people are still on the "it's the flu bruh" train here means it'll only get worse before it even better states have declared state of emergency for less cases yet here we are don't close schools don't worry aboutass gatherings I mean come on half the world is almost on lockdown and even New York has parts that are on lockdown yet we are still downplaying it people who are actually worried and concerned are looked at in the same sense that were talking about alien invasion.
I mean ALL of Italy just went into lockdown.
Governments were very successful instilling fear to make lockdowns world, now they want to come out of lockdown in many areas you meet a barrier that the fear is so ingrained people resist a return to normality.
Because they started during the lockdown the number of contacts to trace was around two instead of the 6-10 they were expecting so it became relatively easier to tract down and kill off infection chains.
Not only tests that’s are accurate but tests for every single person here and lockdown again.
* Pickup only from restaurants, have not eaten on premise since before lockdown started.

An antibody_test using blood which can test if you have been exposed in the past 10-90 days or so.
Question: does anyone here have current data on how reliable the antibody_test is in this area?
People are now telling me the antibody_test is fake and or not reliable at all.
Hi! While I don’t have antibody_test statistics on tap right now, i wouldn’t necessarily believe the folks saying it’s fake and not reliable.
I hope your antibody_test is positive, but for what it's worth, a bunch of my friends also here in Arizona got really sick back in February like you did and they tested negative for antibodies in a blood test in April.
I don’t want in any way to discourage you from perusing a test but the antibody_tests are only good for a couple of weeks after infection, with one test claiming a couple of months, but there is no solid evidence that the tests are effective after a few weeks.
Definitely continue with the quarantine and get an antibody_test once she’s feeling better.
Perhaps get an antibody_tests to see if you had COVID and got a false_negative from the delay.

The state's total case count includes individuals who tested positive on a diagnostic PCR_test as well as individuals who tested positive on an antibody_test who had COVID-19 symptoms or were linked to a known case.
Serology or antibody_tests determine whether the person being tested **had** an infection in the past (and now has antibodies against the disease).
Later, he tested negative for antibodies and said that his illness was a “mystery.” There are several headlines saying he never had covid, but apparently antibody_tests aren’t that reliable — they can be wrong to begin with, or the person had covid but never had antibodies, or the person had covid and only had antibodies briefly.
Yet evidence indicates that many of these children were infected with the COVID-19 virus in the past, as shown by positive antibody_test_results.
This isn't a new idea, these are estimates from the CDC based on antibody_testing.

The government’s disease-fighting agency is conflating viral and antibody_tests, compromising a few crucial metrics that governors depend on to reopen their economies.
Donated blood last week - antibody_tested negative, for what it's worth.
Just as a heads up, if you believe you may have had it back in March the antibody_test will not be accurate.
Don't bother getting the antibody_test.

months before antibody_testing for the disease was even available to begin studies to determine what the real CFR was.
I had a conservative aquantaince on facebook who was posting bullshit yesterday about how the covid #s are mostly antibody_tests and that masks are useless.

Do the new positive cases number include people with positive antibody_tests?
" Our [Data Dashboard] contains information about both diagnostic PCR and serologic antibody_testing with options to filter the data by either type of test (see the [blog post] on these dashboard features).
This went from everybody needing an antibody_test, to people that are high risk getting the pcr test.
The data was skewed by the antibody_tests that showed the downward trajectory in positive cases.
* Robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody_testing.
I had an antibody_test the first week of May.
Then the doctor said he hadn’t seen a single positive antibody_test.
A number of people engaging in the testing blitz are taking both PCR and antibody_tests.
But I’m wondering about the effectiveness of antibody_tests.
They have labs in Tucson and are doing antibody_tests.
I would ask for a repeat of the antibody_test as well - many of these tests have not been effectively validated and your result could wind up being a mistake.
- **Testing:** Since yesterday, PCR_testing spiked significantly & Antibody_testing dropped significantly.
- Testing: PCR & Antibody_testing dropped heavily, likely due to the holiday.
Antibody_testing was about even.
- Testing: PCR & Antibody_testing were relatively level with yesterday's numbers.
Perhaps when the antibody_test becomes more readily available we can get him tested.
Perhaps when the antibody_test becomes more readily available.
At least some of the testing blitz locations offer antibody_testing too.
Also, the antibody_test is available now at Sonora Quest.
I am interested in getting an antibody_test at some point, but I don't leave the house unless I have to right now, and I don't see that as a necessity right now.
Thank you,  I might try and get my son in for the antibody_test Saturday.
- Meh: PCR & Antibody_testing fell again over yesterday.
They should all be able to get antibody_tests at no cost.
- Good: PCR & Antibody_testing both rebounded today, both back up 50%.
Antibody_testing remained about even.
I got my antibody_test_result yesterday (negative), but I still haven't gotten my PCR_test_result.
PCR_tests are up 8%, Antibody_tests plummeted by roughly 47%.
Edit: I should also note I got my test_results on Monday, after having the blood draw for the antibody_testing on Saturday.
I was there last week and only waited in line for maybe 20 minutes in my car, and then another 30 minutes on foot waiting for the antibody_testing.
According to ADHS, only 3.2% of antibody_tests in Arizona are coming back positive.
Many of these antibody_tests are NOT FDA approved.
I wonder what percent of antibody_tests are blood draws vs.
My mom and I did the antibody_test last weekend and both came back negative.
Many of the antibody_tests are seriously flawed as tbey have almost no regulation from the fda.
How about getting antibody_tests for anyone who wants to go back in public?
Since they have changed the way they report numbers to combining the diagnostic PCR and the serology antibody_testing it is harder to determine.
But my wife is getting the antibody_test soon so maybe we will find out.
He’s going to get an antibody_test done soon!
I got an antibody_test Friday via my doctor from LabCorp.

Robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody_testing.
I’d like a little more data/info on antibody_testing or hell, even regular testing before we kick everything back open.
Antibody_testing for people who may have already been infected and built up some immunity to COVID-19 is not part of the effort. 
"New antibody_tests are coming out pretty much every day," Altin said.
Antibody_tests tend to lean towards false_positives because there are other antibodies similar to Covid-19 that can trigger them.
Embry Health (actively testing for Covid, and also active members in this sub) said they are a few weeks out from antibody_testing.
That article says starting today, Sonora Quest can do blood based antibody_tests, by doctor's prescription.
Or would an antibody_test be more accurate?
I guess I’m just asking if you think it would still be worth it for me to do this test, or if I should just do an antibody_test that would detect a past active infection.
The antibody_test checks for prior COVID-19 infection and should be available by the end of next week.
— Do we have the resources to process antibody_tests?
The antibody_tests (of which UA has produced 250,000K) are also reported to be flawed, often producing a false_positive result (ie antibodies present when there are none).
But I think it’s pretty idiotic to be discussing any re-opening of the state(s) until we have a much better idea of the extent of the community spread, and plenty of rapid antibody_tests  in place.
Nor am I able to speculate about what might be causing delays in mass testing or in the production of antibody_tests.
However, it is currently not possible to get a test on-demand — neither a regular or antibody_test.
If you could address the issue in terms of a broader scale (labs, logistics, antibody_tests, costs, etc), I believe everyone would appreciate the contribution.
3)Hospitals: Treat all patients without crisis care and robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody_testing.

[Antibody Test].
Actually, insurance will be covering the antibody_test.
A COVID-19 antibody_test using reagent strip was ordered.
Our office just finalized an order for a bulk quantity of antibody_tests yesterday.
This is the company that we are using to supply the antibody_tests called [RayBiotech] It is their [Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Rapid test_kit] For a point of care test it is actually pretty expensive.
That is great news!! Please keep us updated on the antibody_test and when it becomes available.
If I have antibodies I'll donate, but where can I get the antibody_test?
Now I'm waiting on an antibody_test...
I've been trying to get antibody_testing to see if I actually had COVID (my flu swab and PCR were negative at the time, so it's very likely I had COVID), but right now trying to get antibody_testing is like trying to get COVID testing was back in March.
I got an antibody_test done at Quest, my Dr sent it in and my insurance paid for it (Medicare, but pretty sure ALL insurances are mandated to cover covid testing rn if your Dr orders it, someone plz correct me if I'm wrong).
How did your antibody_test turn out (if you don't mind saying?) Also that sucks about the wait time now, because Quest is the lab I have to do to when my doctor orders tests :(
My question is was this from antibody_test or virus test?
The antibody_tests were released without much rigorous testing on the accuracy.
I've got worse news, there's only one FDA EUA in existence right now for an antibody_test at point of care.
I saw a room full of peoe getting antibody_testing all of them were sure they had it and none of them did.
I think they're developing an antibody_test that can tell if you've ever had it - would be interesting to see if she tests positive.
this page is updated twice a week with all known antibody_tests by a qualified reviewer and has the sensitivity and specificity, if it's not known or not well tested, don't bother because the result is meaningless.
Antibody_testing, plasma donation, crowdsource computing donation  ,
Antibody_testing will give even a clearer picture.
Contact rick@unitedmedco.com and you can get an antibody_test from him.
I want to see what percentage of people who take these antibody_tests actually turn out positive or negative.
Contact rick@unitedmedco.com he has these antibody_tests.
You can contact rick@unitedmedco.com and he can fill you in on how to get an Antibody_test for COVID-19.
"DSHS acknowledged last week that it was reporting an unknown quantity of antibody_tests as part of the "total tests" figure.
No, Dallas County started reporting probable cases (which [includes antigen and antibody_tests] last week.
I did it a few weeks back and was negative.This was the finger prick antibody_test though.
For example, one person told me Texas was conflating the positive tests and antibody_tests.
I was able to show them when they started separating out that data and how small the % of antibody_tests was.
Even if there was a positive antibody_test, it is still not counted as such.
Has he had the antibody_test?
My sister who is a nurse said the antibody_test might not show anything if it was more than six months ago.
Having had both tests, the antibody_test was way less painful than a second nasal swab since the Red Cross was willing to do it for free with your blood donation.
TX DHS said they only include the antibody_test in their positive totals so that is why they excluded these.
There are two results for an antibody_test.
Just like the cases are the result of viral cases + antibody_tests (which it even states you could test positive for the COVID family of viruses which includes a common cold).
On 21 May 2020, The Atlantic Magazine reported on the intentional conflation of the viral and antibody_testing results that the CDC, under Redfield's leadership, has been compiling data on since the beginning of the year.
For example, the state and many counties do not include probable cases: 1) epidemiological evidence (contact tracing) AND clinical symptoms 2) serological test (antigen or antibody_test) AND epidemiological OR clinical evidence 3) vital records (death certificate).
Reduced class size (max of 10), and viral and antibody_testing was required for return.
I donated blood yesterday to Carter Blood Care and they will do the antibody_test on your donated blood as well to see if you have had it.
I didn't know they were doing antibody_testing.
Hugsalot12 says they donated at Carter Blood Care and they did an antibody_test.
And my antibody_test (which I did already get) is negative.
So I'll be negative both and never know until I can get another antibody_test.
So you add antibody_tests to the positive numbers to jack those up and reclassify COVID deaths as pneumonia deaths.
They are combining covid positive and antibody_tests.
As an anecdote, my PCP did my covid test, and mentioned during that he had performed well over 200 antibody_tests, with every single one coming back negative - even the tests given to 2 of his confirmed covid positive patients about 8 weeks After infection.
When antibody_testing came up late May, both her doctor and mine said it wouldn’t show up.
Nurse here, I would not get a antibody_test past a month of symptoms.
You still have t-cells and b-cells, which ramp up antibody production if you are exposed again, but the idea of antibody_testing is kind of drying up.
Many of these antibody_tests are turning out to be awful.
An antibody_test may or may not accurately test for one of those mechanism.
60 Minutes had a good report this past weekend on antibody_tests.
It announced it would allow antibody_tests into the U.S.
My doctors still do not take much stock in these antibody_tests.
Depending on the brand, even the best antibody_tests can miss up to 15% .
Antibody_test in June was negative.
I went at the end of May to get an antibody_test and tested positive.
I wanted to put it to the test and went back a week ago and did the Abbott antibody_test again, which would have been 4 months after being sick.
This is based on antibody_tests and then a massive amount of guessing and extrapolation.
Didn't it just come out that the antibody_tests are wildly inaccurate and they included those in Texas' #s the last few days?
I had it and am waiting on antibody_tests.
Labcorp I know is also doing *free antibody_tests, where you just have to pay a $15 processing fee.
I'll get the antibody_test 2 weeks after my symptoms have subsided.
Finally, it is not clear if the "case" data represent only RT-PCR results or include antibody_tests.
Also, the use of antibody_tests must be seen as a sign of overall population immunity, perhaps from continuous exposure to sub-clinical doses of COVID or from cross reactions with antibodies to other related viruses.
This is the same organization that decided to mix antibody_tests into the total tests without a heads-up or explanation.
Speculated the 5/1 drops might have been to indecisions/judgments made on including antibody_tests, non-PCR_tests, and/or possible clerical indiscrepencies (site of test vs.
You mean the organization that was caught off guard when the counties started to send in antibody_tests?
But I also reached out about historical data surrounding the antibody_test/results and seems they simply weren't collecting/recording, and still aren't! Was advised to just manually track.
2500 positives out of 13,732 tests run isn't great, and that number appears to include antibody_testing which have been at 4.5k a day the last 3 days in a row.
They pulled out the antibody_tests the day the state added them to the dashboard.
As well, over the past two days, missed last night due to work, there have been 5379 antibody_tests run with 243 positives for a rate of 4.5%.
Here's what led me to believe they are including the antibody_test on the Covidtracking.com site.
TxDHS june 9 new tests - 22,000 viral tests, 4,400 antibody_tests.
Same with the antibody_tests?
The botched testing is more along the lines of mixing antibody_tests and PCR_tests and that fact that commercial antibody_tests are LFA stick tests with dubious accuracy.
The antibody_tests were not given to a random population.
The antibody_test only has meaning in the context of the medical history of the person.
The antibody_test is unreliable.
It lumps every antibody_test together, which weights it toward the infection rate where residents have the greatest testing access (typically cities/metro areas).
Instead we have some communities doing random testing, some labs offering only private antibody_testing (self-selected sample, not random), and some communities without such testing readily available.
Well if they antibody_tests represent a full population then new York had a 21% infection rate and Texas has a 4%.
With more and more antibody_testing it's looking like there are significant asymptomatic cases such that the overall mortality rate is close to our under 1%, rather than the 3-6% originally derived from the death rate among symptomatic individuals.
As well, you can see the raw numbers of antibody_tests and the positives from it.
Yes, both of those numbers have removed those horrible antibody_tests.
We have administered 951,865 tests, yes this takes out those horrible antibody_tests, which is 3.2% of the population.
Texas has been testing overall at a 6.8% rate, yes this takes out the horrible antibody_tests, while on a rolling 7 average we are at 4.7%.
They just got caught manipulating data already, something like 6% of the tests were antibody_tests which they tried to cover up at first.
The antibody_test is also not required.
Antibody_tests are currently accepted for confirmed case counts by CDC but DSHS is not yet accepting them because they're only interested in case numbers of current infections.
I got an antibody_test that came back negative, so I’m not sure if the test was wrong, or I simply just did not have it but I’ve never had a cough for that long before in my life.
Did the antibody_test at Lab Corp ($10 total with no insurance), was hoping hoping it would be positive, but it was negative.
For anyone reading this later, Lab Corp is offering the antibody_test for a flat fee of $10.
The fee goes towards their doctor who prescribes the antibody_test for you.
We are utilizing the Abbott IgG antibody_test.
However they have strongly emphasized to not trust any antibody_tests as they are out right now.
Both my wife and I had antibody_tests done last week and we both tested negative.
I am by no means an expert on antibody_tests, but I have been trying to find as much information as possible and learn more about them.
I told her she should get an antibody_test.
We both got an antibody_test via Quest and both came back negative.
Like i mentioned, I think one of the problems with the antibody_tests available is that they can produce a false_negative.
edit: obviously antibody_testing is a real life situation, but I am referring to any particular instances of studying populations in certain locations etc.
between by adding antibody_tests to thier totals and changing the criteria for testing, we cant particularly trust reported numbers to give us a full picture.
I don't see a positive rate increase overall in the State of Texas though (even if you remove antibody_tests).
The numbers are close to the WorldoMeter site that Guttergano suggested but drills down a bit more with antibody_testing.
if it does, they're either reporting an antibody_test or taking weeks to process new tests.
What's your opinion on the revelation this past week that Texas had been mixing antibody_tests in with the rest?
The amount of antibody_tests was so small it is insignificant.
Ya if numbers are being manipulated then that's going to be a problem! I guess the best way to figure it out is through antibody_testing for covid after it's over..
I’m a little surprised by the antibody_tests being included.
My employer paid for 80+ employees to get the antibody_test just as a matter of course before re-opening the office.
Especially since that is the day that Texas dropped antibody_tests onto the dashboard.
*The day Texas separated antibody_tests out of the main number of tests run, and gave them their own test administered number and number of probable resolved.
Also the FDA is dealing with a flood of inaccurate coronavirus antibody_tests after it allowed more than 120 manufacturers and labs to bring the tests to market without an agency review.
**"Of the 12 antibody_tests that were studied by the COVID-19 Testing Project, one of the tests gave false_positives more than 15% of the time, or in about one out of seven samples.
"A number of commercially available COVID-19 antibody_tests, which look at a patient’s blood for signs of past infection, did not pass Mayo Clinic quality screening or meet their expectations for use, researchers from the hospital concluded in a joint investigation by the clinic and ABC News.
So were the positive antibody_tests included in the total positive numbers too?
If they want to report resolved cases based on antibody_tests with the totals that fine, but they need to let people know what they are doing.
Usually the antibody_tests are applied to a larger population and/or a random sample while the swab tests are usually reserved just for people with symptoms or history of direct contact.
Counting a positive antibody_test as a recovered number rather than a positive case is just muddying the waters yet again.
Of the 49,313 antibody_tests, 2,114 — or 4.3% — have come back positive, according to the new data.
It's been a designation going back to at least early March, so there's no way all of the Probable cases are antibody_tests.
It is nice to see them and be able to get a picture of the population illness based off of percentage of positive antibody_tests.
The information dating back from when antibody_tests started coming in until this change on DSHS, was misleading.
We did just barely make the 25k/day average testing goal last week, with these antibody_tests mixed in.
My local area had DSHS reported probable cases going back to early March; well before antibody_tests were available.
They're still listed as Probable despite being active cases with no antibody_tests.
They've been tracking Probable cases since at least March; based on epidemiological links and/or clinical symptoms with no PCR/swab/blood/antibody_test.
They weren't confirmed cases and their health never warranted a test because back then, the availability wasn't there for a regular test, let alone an antibody_test.
I have been watching the state dashboard and they literally just showed up with the antibody_tests.
Yes the same state govt that has been lying about including antibody_tests in the test count.
And at the time, there probably weren't  many antibody_tests yet but they increased sample size to keep the positive rate down.
The sudden doubling of tests done on those 2 days last week makes a lot more sense now that we know unreliable antibody_tests were being added in to the totals make people more comfortable doing business amidst the pandemic in order to maintain political prospects at the expense of lives.
Testing volume and % positive are important things to watch, are benchmarks for reopening, and had been off the mark by the inclusion of the 49k antibody_tests.
Data was there all along, whether it was #'s of antibody_tests that should have been kept separate or #'s of cases in nursing homes, which the state had been keeping tab of and also reluctant to release.
I think the State was caught off guard by the counties rolling in antibody_tests when they first dropped them all on the 13th.
It is starting to show the true nature by bringing in these antibody_tests and displaying their data for the world to see.
The antibody_tests have a high rate of false_positives, you'd think they would only include that data if they had a high rate of false_negatives.
And, none of this even bothers mentioning that the antibody_tests throw off a lot of false_positives which would INFLATE the infected numbers.
And, with such a high percentage of false_positives on the antibody_tests it's really boosting the infection numbers making it look worse than it really is!
They're talking about the results of some of those antibody_tests, which are not accurate enough to get reliable data.
That data will come when there is a blanket antibody_test across the country, but no sooner.
I'm also concerned that antibody_tests are being counted along with viral tests, even though the antibody_tests have less than an 80% accuracy rate.
Antibody_tests are only useful to figure out what percent of a population has been infected, but instead they're being used to tell if an individual was infected.
Antibody_test or not...
It's saying that antibody_tests and viral tests are measuring different things, and combining them (as many Texas counties have done) obscures the data.
Antibody_tests determine if you've been infected *in the past* (could be a week ago, could be months ago).
In my area, it is much easier to get an antibody_test than a viral test, because viral tests are limited to those who are symptomatic and preference is given to those who are in at-risk groups.
I would think that antibody_tests have lower positive test rates, since you don't have to show symptoms to get one (they are given out more freely because there is a greater supply of them).
TLDR: Texas is combining viral and antibody_tests, which doesn't make sense.
I am seriously thinking about paying for the antibody_test just so I can live guilt free.
No longer are we reporting positive antibody_tests.
I wouldn't report any positive or negative antibody_tests either because people will think they're accurate (which they aren't yet), some of them are so bad they're useless.
The worst thing they could do is report a bunch of false_positive antibody_tests making people think they're in the clear.
Thank you though for informing me about how inaccurate antibody_tests are.
except they started including some unknown number of antibody_tests in the "total tests" number so we can't trust it.
I really want to get an antibody_test when they become more easily accessible so I can know for sure.
And antibody_tests are widely available, in Dallas anyway.
So all those claims by people in this sub and irl that case count is so high because antibody_tests are included was a complete fabrication then?
The most common argument I run into recently though is that the outbreak isn't actually all that bad, the numbers just look that way because they include antibody_tests.
Antibody_tests aren't a diagnostic test.
The concern is that low % positive can be inflated by doing a lot of antibody_testing, or double-test the same people.
Not saying (accurate) antibody_tests have no value, but they reveal a different kind of data that should not be mixed with pcr tests, and should not add to aggregate test count.
Antibody_testing has supported the conclusion that roughly 1 in 5 residents have apparently already contracted and cleared the virus.
1) These Antibody_tests are a yes or no.
I have a question about antibody_testing.
If this is the case, why is anyone getting antibody_tests??
I have no idea what kind of test OP took, but considering what you've just said and the TONS of ads I've seen about antibody_testing, I think there is some shady misrepresentation of services going on across the country.
They sent it to quest for the lab work, according to quest their antibody_test is 90% accurate.
We don’t have antibody_tests.
Ive heard the rate of testing has doubled, while percentage of positives have decreased and am aware of antibody_tests supposedly being mixed in but no actual confirmed proof or numbers on that.
[DSHS confirmation re antibody_testing quoted here].
"It’s unclear what portion of the state’s case counts so far are based on antibody_tests"
**A spokesperson for DSHS confirmed to the Observer that the agency includes “some antibody results” in its official statistics.** “Now that antibody_tests have become more available, we are working to provide data by type of test and whether cases are confirmed cases of active infection identified by [viral] test or probable cases identified by antibody_tests,” Lara Antone, the spokesperson, wrote in an email Thursday evening.
She did not answer specific questions about how many of the tests or positive cases included in Texas’ count so far are based on antibody_tests, why they are being included, or when these test_results will be delineated.
You said there was no confirmed proof of antibody_tests mixed in.
Antone said the state health department does not attribute the increase in results this week to antibody_tests, but would not say how many were antibody_tests, or when the state began combining these with the viral tests.
Especially when nobody in Texas is using antibody_tests that have better than 60-75% accuracy, from what I've been hearing.
Regarding the efficacy of the tests, all I know is the city of San Antonio has rejected multiple antibody_tests as recently as this past week because they fall below (sometimes well below) 85% or generate too many false_positives.
A false_positive for an antibody_test (as compared to a false_negative)  is especially bad because someone would think they are safe or immune when they are in fact not.
I read an article this morning that stated that Texas has started including positive antibody_tests in their daily report on new cases.
If you are willing to pay quest diagnostics has an antibody_test for $98 no Dr.
For what it's worth I have been advised by my doctors who treated me for COVID to not take any antibody_tests as their accuracy isn't very good.
There are many antibody_tests, with accuracies ranging from ~70% to 99%.
Hard to wrap my head around this concept! But gee whiz not sure getting antibody_test is all that useful, especially given we don't know if the degree of immunity the antibodies proffer.
***If you receive a positive antibody_test_result, it has a 32.1% chance of being accurate***
Antibody_tests are *most* useful at the population level.
Additionally, if you do 2 antibody_tests a week apart, and they're both positive, then a 10% false_positive rate drops to .1%.
Antibody_tests are not currently accepted for confirmed case counts by DSHS, although CDC appears to be accepting them.
Now that antibody_testing is available a group of us that were ill back then went.
You realize how many of those antibody_tests throw off false_positives?
Was it abbot labs antibody_test that is 99.6 accurate.
An antibody_test is not a positive test.
The other big thing that they were doing that was inflating numbers, was to count antibody_tests as a positive.
The antibody_tests will become less and less important for current stats wth time, but more and more important gauging herd immunity.
However the antibody_tests seem to show its much lower due to people contracting the virus with no symptoms.
Now it's easy to get antibody_tests also, to see if you've already had it.
Are these antibody_tests accurate?
Now it's easy to get antibody_tests also.
I would like to get Antibody Tested in Houston, but I can't find any info on it currently.
I just got an antibody_test from Quest yesterday, they draw blood and send it to a lab, they do not do the finger test....
We suspect we were both already infected in early April though, want to get antibody_tests when possible.
Dude, as soon as I hear about reliable antibody_testing being available in my area, I’m getting in line.
Yep, watching and waiting on the antibody_testing.
I want to do an antibody_test, but I am not sure how to go about it.
A friend of mine from there was negative on the Covid test but positive on the antibody_test.
There's also people like me who got sick already and recovered, but without antibody_testing can't be 100% sure it was covid.
In my case I'm reasonably sure so there's no point to sheltering anymore, particularly when they promised antibody_testing last month but we probably won't even see it this month.
Still planning to go for antibody_testing whenever that comes out with a reliable, affordable test.
I got an antibody_test today.
Throw in an antibody_testing and that number plummets.
Given the recent Reuters article showing 95-96% asymptomatic rate for positive-testing subjects, the fact that mask use is fairly uncommon and the stores which are open are roughly just as busy as they always were, and the antibody_testing results fron NY suggesting 25% of NY state residents have already been infected, I'm fairly confident that the virus has already spread to a significant penetration depth and re-opening won't cause any such massive spike.
3.) A doctor I follow on social media provides lots of info daily on covid and he says that Texas numbers are starting to include antibody_testing results, which means we will be seeing spikes in case numbers for recovered cases since people who were not tested for covid who do show antibodies would count as a covid case but be listed as recovered.
Antibody_testing is pretty inaccurate unless there are a lot of real positives in an area.
What I would like to see is more randomized antibody_testing done over time, since I think this would help us understand the prevalence and trend.
I do believe it has been shown, through antibody_testing, that there is a significantly higher percentage of the population infected than tested positive, largely because so many people have such mild symptoms.
Not because I’m in the “open it up now” camp (I’m not, I believe in following the numbers), but because we haven’t seen a massive case increase and NY just did antibody_tests and those are showing 20% infected.
I would also love to see an antibody_test and some intelligence around the topic of resiliency/immunity.
We need rapid tests to detect people currently infected, and antibody_tests to determine what percentage of people have been infected.
Assuming that it does, then widespread antibody_testing tells us which areas are more resistant to the virus.
Still don't have near enough to check all the population and my doctor hasn't been able to find a hook up for any antibody_testing at all.
A bunch of us want antibody_testing to find out if we did have it as a lot of people were ill with the exact symptoms.
My doctor wants access to accurate, reasonably priced antibody_testing to see if we've had it but has so far been unsuccessful.
What kind of antibody_tests?
There's a lot of news stories about faulty antibody_tests if you dig.
I don't know about anywhere else in Texas, but there are several places in the DFW area that are offering antibody_testing.
I DO know the antibody_testing they are conducting does not tell you whether you HAD it or whether you HAVE it.
If you test positive for the antibody_test they are offering, you are recommended to go and receive the test or quarantine yourself for 14 days.
And I just had the antibody_testing in DFW last week.
I have a family member that was able to get an appointment with quest to get antibody_testing this week.
There are upwards of 14 antibody_tests on the market now, and only 1 or 2 are FDA-approved.
The over 80 stats for flu are still lower than even with antibody_tests for covid for all ages.
The antibody_test is virtually 100% accurate for positive results, but gives back a significant number false_negatives.
I've actually heard that antibody_tests generally have higher false_positives, so I also doubt his claims.
I think we shouldn't play up too many of the cases starting before January but I would be curious about antibody_tests for people who were ill in March.
The case load was building higher then so though people can't assume they have gotten it, I think doing antibody_tests to check for plasma donors and extent of spread is within consideration.
Since the estimated true number of cases is 20-100x the confirmed case number, it's more important than ever to have antibody_testing.
ANTIBODY_TESTING: For current customers - CommunityMed Urgent Care (By Walmart on 380) is seeing pateints for COVID Antibody_testing & swab testing.
My PCP outside of Houston is doing antibody_tests.
$300 for an antibody_test (unless it is part of a trial where they charge $150).
I signed up for an antibody_test and am paying $85 (lab in Richmond).
They never tested for antibodies because there was no antibody_test at that tkme, so they have no idea how many people already had it and we're recovered.
What they're doing now is antibody_testing coupled with testing for active infection, the data changes almost daily.
Source on the antibody_testing, please?
I'd happily drive to Houston or wherever I must for antibody_testing.
I am aware of ARCpoint Labs offering non-FDA approved antibody_tests.
Antibody_test in LA County suggests upwards of 55x more people (200k-442K) have had the virus than have tested positive to date (7,900).
I don't have symptoms and I want both a test and an antibody_test if the first proves negative.
My doctor said they’re reserving tests for people who are sick, and I haven’t heard of any antibody_tests yet in SA.
Edit: I just looked and there was one doc doing antibody_tests in SA but not the fda approved ones.
What they'd need are antibody_tests.
I’ll be glad when they have an antibody_test.
It is less clear what those antibody_tests mean for real life, however, because immunity functions on a continuum.
They’ve emailed all their patients to come take the test if they need it, or even the antibody_test! I know that doesn’t represent all of Texas, but it’s a good look over here in Haslet!
Indeed, the NYT says that many of the antibody_test_kits are coming from China (and they don't work very well).
I don’t know if I can feel comfortable taking steps to get those parts of my life back without better insight trough tests to see if people have it or antibody_tests to see if we had it and have recovered.
My lab will start validating a new test tomorrow and we hope to do between 150-200 antibody_tests per day.
But this is probably not including antibody_tests.
Antibody_tests all over the world are pointing to the Iceberg theory being right.
Without testing everyone and antibody_testing everyone we don't know if the other 90% already had it previously, or we're just testing the wrong people and there are still huge numbers we're simply not catching because testing isn't available where they are.
Without antibody_testing everyone there is no knowing how far it spread now.
I’m at a lab in North Dallas that is working to get the antibody_tests out there.
We are utilizing the Abbott IgG antibody_test and hope to add the IgM when it becomes available.
The UK has bought all sorts of antibody_tests but still can't find any accurate enough to use.
Thailand has been using antibody_test strips for a month, I'm rather curious to know how accurate those have been.
Although they probably need antibody_testing now as most of us were very ill about 3 weeks ago.
There are also private labs doing antibody_tests in Harris as well.
He tested positive for Flu A around Feb 15, he said at the time it was the worst flu he has had, but apparently it wasn't the flu based on the antibody_test.
Is the Abbott testing antibody_testing though?
The antibody_tests that are out there right now are largely not FDA approved yet.
As of the past 2-3 weeks, it seems like testing has been pretty widely available in TX and even antibody_tests are out in the wild now.
You can now also go get antibody_tests at private labs, 4 family members were tested last week, one that was sick in early Feb (before Covid testing was out) tested positive for antibodies.
I can't wait until they have the antibody_test done.
I’m hoping they are able to introduce a quick antibody_test so we can all determine if we’ve been exposed.
Now I'm just hoping antibody_testing will eventually become available.
I have a question for anybody who would be able to give me some insight - I have a test scheduled on the 24th for an antigen, but it says its a non FDA approved antibody_test.
I'll make sure to get an antibody_test when it becomes available!
I have a feeling given the asymptomatic aspect when we get antibody_testing online we will see a large percentage of the population has been exposed.
Once antibody_tests are around, I'm definitely gonna see about getting that confirmation just for my own satisfaction.
But by your logic, antibody_testing wouldn’t do anything either.
I can have zero exposure to the virus today and get antibody_testing which comes back negative, and then tomorrow morning get the virus at the gas station but think I’m fine while I go spread it around until I get symptoms (*if* I get symptoms).
I want widely available and FREE antibody_testing.
Either pay us for shutting down our businesses/jobs, or give everybody antibody_tests/masks/etc and reasonable guidelines for a partial reopening.
As soon as I can get an Antigen Antibody_test to see if I already had it, I'm willing to go back to work doing whatever is necessary and fits my abilities.
We need actual wide scale testing and antibody_testing but given that Texas has done virtually nothing with regard to testing as % of the population there isn't much hope there.
Gonna be the end of May before the US gets its act together for antibody_testing, yet Thailand has a 15-minute antibody_test strip they've been using for weeks now.
These new test are antibody_tests which are different than the diagnostic tests.
No, these are not antibody_tests.
I must have read or got a different article mixed up about the antibody_tests.
After negotiations with the manufacturer, Paris officials placed an order for Covid-19 antibody_tests late Friday afternoon, putting the city in the national forefront with plans for drive-thru testing.
With an initial 5,000 kits and a prospect of purchasing more as needed, the city could be among the first communities in the nation to provide mass antibody_testing.
News reports on antibody_testing flooded national news reports early Friday morning.
Just as Clifford and Hasmi told city councilors Thursday, the Journal explained how antibody_testing works.
1) We really need antibody_testing for the entire population.
I wasn't able to get tested at the time (3 weeks ago), and tbh I've given up until the antibody_tests roll out.
Everything cleared up after day 8 or 9, I too would love an antibody_test.
Planning to do antibody_tests?
Also, antibody_testing is the type of testing that some experts say we need before we open everything again.
Antibody_tests are not reliable for "active" infections.
Your best bet might be to look towards UW Virology for antibody_tests; I'm not sure if they even offer these for SARS-CoV-2 yet, though.
Someone was talking about that earlier, the difference between an antigen and an antibody_test.
So we need both: a rapid antigen_test to look for current infection, and antibody_tests so we can study how many people already had it and whether / how long immunity lasts.
That, and we don't have blood antibody_testing yet to figure out how widespread the virus has reached.
I'm looking forward to the antibody_test becoming available.
I wish  I could give to antibody_testing but I got a tattoo two months ago, and if memory serves, plasma like that can't be used for a year.
That is referring to COVID-19 test_kits, not COVID-19 antibody_test_kits.
I am waiting for the antibody_test_kit.
I’m looking for an antibody_test that is available for the general public.
Once the antibody_tests are mass-produced and a lot of the population is tested and the epidemiologists are turned loose there is much to be learned.
Does anybody know when to expect antibody_tests?
I work in the radiology dept and still see a steady stream of Covid-19 cases coming through with ONE notable change: The test_results.
A patient comes to the ER with Covid symptoms, so ER runs a rapid test to get faster results, but they send the patient to radiology for imaging before the test_results come back.
Just had a friend, still waiting for her test_results after two weeks, who had to say her last goodbye to her husband through a glass window.
A friend of mine is on day 13 of waiting for test_results.
If you stop testing, you won't have bad test_results?
What about the fact that test_results are taking 10+ days to come back?
Turnaround time for test_results is 24-48 hours.
Demand is down because people have heard it’s taking 2 weeks to get test_results back and not bothering with it.
Maybe not an exact address but a mark to show there are this many people on this side of the city that have tested positive or are pending test_results.
Despite the availability of widespread testing, obtaining test_results in a timely manner to allow effective contact tracing does not exist at this time in our communities.”
Do you need test_results for work or just for your own info?
Waiting for test_results).
Every company policy I have personal experience with seems to be not paying their employees while they wait for test_results.
Nurses are being told to go back to work until they have a test_result or are too sick to work.
Any company > 500 people has to cover "sick time" out of their own profit margin, so they're not paying "sick time" to asymptomatic employees that are awaiting test_results for two weeks because they can't afford to piss off their owners/shareholders/board.
Friedman,  was just on the Sunday political shows this morning saying that the number of tests is a useless statistic unless you have  test_results within 24 -48 hours and then you have  effective contact tracing so you can identify the contacts and quarantine.
It's a numbers game, big number of test_results are our friends even with a higher percentage of error...its information of SCALE we need, not exact surgical long delay numbers.
I got my test_results on my 11th day of waiting.
I heard from the state before I heard back my test_results.
test_results came back 21 days later.
Big problems persist for researchers trying to piece together more precisely how the virus is spreading in Arizona, including the lag times in the reporting of coronavirus cases and in confirming test_results.
I know in South Korea, their contact tracing is so good, you get an alert to your phone if a positive case is near your area and exactly where they visited prior to their positive test_result so you can avoid that business until it’s cleaned.
Do you keep them home for fourteen days waiting on a test_result that might take two or three weeks to show up?
I just got my test_results back.
She has cancer and needs treatment and can’t get it until she gets a negative test_result.
I think the "hopeful" take on this is that SonoraQuest isn't able to process as many tests right now because they're getting their new testing machine set up, at which point we'd see a massive jump in daily test_results.
It makes contact tracing impossible and while waiting for test_results most people are still running around infecting other people.
Last week, I still didn't have my test_results and started to think they must have gotten "lost".
I’m sure Ducey is relieved we have all these backlogged test_results so he can use incomplete data.
When you stop reporting test_results timely of course it looks like our case count is decreasing.
Given the ongoing disruption in test_result reporting, how can Ducey draw reliable inferences from the data?
It is currently taking 12+ days for test_results from Quest.
Given the current wait times for test_results it would be nearly impossible to contact trace and test every child, teacher, parent or parental guardian in that school.
My husband’s boss just got his test_results after waiting 2 weeks.
Just like the test_results.
Since hospitals tests take priority, and have been ensured to to have 24-48 hour test_result return time.
I've seen in the past that you've shared this may be due to a more recent test_result for the same patient - do you think that's still the most likely cause?
~7 days out for symptoms to show and ~10-12 days for test_results puts us at Tuesday-Thursday of this week.
We don't have a dedicated Covid unit anymore because it's near impossible to get test_results in time to determine where the patient should go, so each unit has a mix of positive and negative patients.
This is from Eric Fink in Tucson.."The data dashboard for Sonora Quest shows more than 60,000 [\#COVID19] test_results are pending statewide.
He is definitely taking advantage of these backlogged test_results.
IMO those numbers mean more than test_results, since those aren’t dependent on processing and testing capacity constraints.
And that leads us to testing, if many folks have to wait days for test_results, then it def makes sense to mask up.
test_results came Wednesday (4 days).
My wife's test_results were lost the first time.
I need to get a "positive" result for work--they offer some financial help for missed work if you can show a positive test_result.
Is it due to the delays in test_results?
And if someone in the hospital is waiting on a test_result are they counted as a COVID patient or just regular patient?
My SIL has been waiting thirteen days for test_results.
Hospital patients (at least in my hospital) waiting for a test_result is just labeled as pending or person under investigation (PUI).
I'm still holding to the assumption that when they say "35K per day" they mean they're going to report 35K per day - therefore they're holding back some test_results so they can be closer to that number at the end of the month.
Arizona nursing home officials say waits of more than a week for COVID-19 test_results have made it difficult to detect and control the highly infectious virus that has killed hundreds of residents statewide.  
Slow test_results have also hampered a state-led initiative to do mass testing in nursing homes. So much so that two months after Gov.
 The turn-around time for when Arizona nursing homes receive test_results falls short of [Centers for Disease Control guidelines] for rapid response. 
test_results can take 3-4 weeks.
In fact that turn around was the fastest I've ever received my yearly test_results.
You'll get your test_results in 7-10 days, if you're lucky.
Many people are being treated as covid19 patients even though their test_results are not available.
Some people start treatment and eventually get a positive test_result.
Because of the lack of testing_kits & delay in getting test_results, doctors have been treating people based on symptoms.
2 of my friends who are Covid19 never had a positive test_result, yet they have all the symptoms and are being treated as such.
We can't even get test_result on Covid patients in the hospital immediately.
My sister got tested at a CVS Minute Clinic 9 days ago & still doesn't have test_results.
With the lagging test_results, we’re solidly in the 22% positive range last week.
Yet evidence indicates that many of these children were infected with the COVID-19 virus in the past, as shown by positive antibody test_results.
With the lagging test_results, we’re solidly in the 22% positive range from two weeks ago.
If I end up infected, I can’t return to work without an all-clear from a doctor and a negative test_result.
“The goal is to have test_results available within 24 hours for anyone tested,”
Around 50% of test_results are taking more than 7 days to come back.
Sonoraquest is really lagging with the test_results though, it's an estimated 8-9 days.
When it is up and running, it should quicken the time it takes for people to get their test_results.
With the lagging test_results, we’re solidly in the **22% positive range last week**.
But if we are so far behind on test_results, it may be a month before we see any kind of improvement in the numbers.
After what lag does getting a PCR_test_result become meaningless?
They are currently forced to do take out only simply because they have too many employees quarantined waiting for covid test_results.
With the lagging test_results, we’re nearing 22% positive on cases from last week.
Oooo okay thank you!!! So today’s positive test_results are 27%.
I have majority of the symptoms and I got my test_results back and it was negative.
With the lagging test_results, we’re holding steady at 21% positive on cases from two weeks ago.
Even this delay is not too bad - as increasingly test_results are delayed by two weeks.
Phew!! Just waiting on those bloody test_results.
Tests like these swabs have what are called positive and negative predictive values, no result is 100% indication of anything except the test_result.
Anybody know a testing spot to get really quick covid test_results?
I don't know if there is any way to get the test_results back quicker.
With the lagging test_results, we’ve now bumped up to 21% positive on cases from last week’s tests.
The daily reporting of test_results and fatalities has been all over the map since the beginning of them releasing the information.
We already know that there was a mistake made earlier in the week, with one of the labs not submitting positive test_results in a timely manner, and thus making it seem like we had 600 or so cases.
My wife has had her first test lost and second test_results delayed several times.
Our testing is so good that I’m on day 5 of waiting for my test_results, and a friend of mine is on day 8.
Many employers require a positive test_result before someone can take work off, so they're working while they are sick and awaiting results.
His test_results comes back tomorrow despite zero symptoms.
We’ve learned that the CDC is making, at best, a debilitating mistake: combining test_results that diagnose current coronavirus infections with test_results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus.
The church's rector and bishop are now in quarantine and awaiting test_results.
The bishop and I are being tested, which requires us to quarantine at least until our test_results come back," said Fr.
We’ve been having these crazy testing blitzes where people wait for six hours and then they don’t get their test_results for 10 days.
They are in the hospital awaiting test_results but this is speculative.
“I don’t want to paint a picture of nothing being done, but  having a test_result helps move care along.”
It is insane to me that they can’t treat you without a positive test_result when testing is lagging so much.
I agree with you that it's problematic to expect people to self-isolate for 14 days without a test_result, especially if they can't get time off work.
Another alarming issue mentioned in the article was that hospitalized patients are having to wait for test_results too.
I do not want to scare you but I would still quarantine even with a negative test_result.
Less positive test_results just takes the heat off of his agenda.
I ask, because looking at the PCR_test_results on the [dashboard] it looks like right now, last M-Th have already been more-or-less reported out, and these results are from F-Su (typically lower collection days) and a bit from Monday.
I heard thru a friend that does lab testing that we are about to see major delays in test_results coming back due to the backlog - my uncle’s test took 10 days to come back, when a month ago, I got my test back (negative thankfully!) within 48 hours.
One related to delays in getting test_results and one for people to get symptoms.
They cannot go back to work until they each have two consecutive negative test_results.
So, what were his test_results?
**IF** the positive % of test_results was going down, that would be a valid perspective (6% of 100 tests (like in early to mid may) is 6 positive results, 3% of 1,000 tests would be 30).
But the positive test_results have been climbing with the additional and wider availability of testing, it’s at 15% so far this week.
I seriously doubt that'll be the case, but "let's try for a little positivity here" (which, interestingly enough, seems to be Ducey's stance when it comes to AZ COVID-19 test_results).
Also I hear constantly of people who are waiting upwards of 10-14 days to even get their test_results back.
I'd also question whether the case in Bullhead City was, in fact, misattributed, or if the relative was just upset because of her understanding of a negative test_result and wanting to push the opinion that it wasn't the actual, proximate cause of death.
I’m so sad to hear that anyone at the property has contracted Covid & I hope your test_results come back negative & you stay healthy and safe!🖤
Now the positive test_results are in the 12-14% range.
Increase testing does not equal the increased incidence of positive test_result percentages.
AZ can't even get test_results back to you before you're dead.
That does not explain why the % of positive test_results is increasing per the laboratory testing dashboard, nor the increased covid specific hospitalization metrics on that dashboard.
(:48) Q: about delay of test_results(?), delayed increase in cases  A: seen more activity after reopening economy - holiday, "righteous cause" - saw lots of masks.
Also, I have no idea if those numbers of tests being done align with the test_results.
Either there are significantly more people who aren't getting tested, those test_results are not being reported, I don't know, but it's peculiar.
My question there was - Are people no longer required to sign something saying that they will isolate til they get their test_results?
I believe that more than 90% of all test_results are negative.
I finally got my PCR_test_results back (negative) from the testing blitz at Embry on 5/16.
I still haven't received my test_results from the testing blitz on May 16, so take everything with a huge grain of salt.
Per the double asterisk note at the bottom  under the individual testing numbers and referenced in the individual testing results “Percent positive is the number of people with a positive test_result, out of all people wit COVID-19 testing completed in AZ.”
Percent positive is the number of people with a positive test_result, out of all people wit COVID-19 testing completed in AZ.
I got my antibody test_result yesterday (negative), but I still haven't gotten my PCR_test_result.
I suspect that my test was counted in the weekend numbers, my antibody result was counted in yesterday's or today's numbers, and my PCR_test_result will be counted on whatever day the result comes back.
My coworker who is well over his 40s and is not athletic seemed to get over it in a week or so after his positive test_result.
Highly likely I have it, waiting on test_results, but yes, at least 6 that had it.
Edit: I should also note I got my test_results on Monday, after having the blood draw for the antibody testing on Saturday.
127,750 @ 7.36% = 9,402 to 127,750 @ 7.44% = 9,595 a margin of error of almost 200 positive test_results.
“We are concerned that there is a lack of access to testing and targeted education concerning COVID-19 within our communities of color,” the letter reads. “Without adequate access to testing and targeted community outreach, DHS’s data concerning positive test_results may be flawed.”  
But before the test_results came back, his condition went downhill.  He died April 7. One day later, his test came back positive, she said.
Having ~15 days between each increase in opening means we will have just enough time to see the effects of the change start showing up in the charts (5-14 days to show symptoms, 1-5 days for test_results), meaning that we should be able to pivot and withdraw on the hopeful plans if we start approaching hospital capacity too fast.
I don't have a factual answer but I really believe it's just that there are much much fewer people running tests, reporting test_results, and inputting the numbers into the system on Saturday and Sunday.
Section 3 says they “must develop policies and procedures to facilitate the admission and readmission of residents who are ready for safe discharge from an acute care hospital without the requirement of a negative COVID-19 test_result.”
Right now it's taking about 60 hours to get test_results back.
Walgreens is planing to open an Arizona test site that will give test_results in 5 minutes, but it will also be limiting its testing to high risk populations.
It seems that this was only before test_results returned positive.
This is just theory but since test_results lag so far behind this is my best guess.
Just because Banner is sticking swabs up people's noses now doesn't mean test_results are coming back any faster.
Keep us updated on test_results if possible!!
How the hell did they not get a single test_result back for today?
I'm not saying that was your argument, but it sounds like u/Frnklfrwsr believes we didn't get a test_result back simply because we haven't been updated yet.
Yet all Southwest Florida health care  systems who responded to us said they report both positive and negative  test_results.*
First multiple pages are fine, then boom over 200 labs are missing their negative test_results.
The test_results also need to be returned rapidly - 24 to 48 hours.
No death certificate can list the cause of death as COVID unless the person has a confirmed positive test_result for COVID.
Still waiting on test_results from Jun.
Meanwhile going around with your ‘negative’ test_results thinking you are fine but infecting everyone you come into contact with.
The number of positive test_results has increased from 50,567 on 5/24 to 109,014 on 6/24.
Also, people’s test_results take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks to get back.
“As  you start to test more and more people over time, you’re going to have  fewer positive test_results,” she said.
The document repeatedly explains cases = individual with a positive COVID-19 test_result.
* Information about cases, which are those **persons who have COVID-19 positive test_results on file**
* Florida Residents Tested Elsewhere: The total number of Florida residents **with positive COVID-19 test_results** who were tested outside of Florida and were not exposed/infectious in Florida.
* Non-Florida Residents Tested in Florida: The total number of people **with positive COVID-19 test_results** who were tested, exposed, and/or infectious while in Florida, but are legal residents of another state.
Oddly, his wife who has not isolated herself from him, has a negative test_result and shows no symptoms, but was sick as hell back in October/November of 2019 with "something".
But health experts are concerned the statewide total of confirmed cases is [significantly undercounted] because Florida reports only the number of Floridians waiting to hear test_results from state labs, not private ones — and private labs are completing more than 90% of state tests.
By the time she received a positive test_result, Ms.
Population does exist, did you know Florida has one of the best percentages of negative test_results at 90%?
did you know lying about test_results exists though?
ANY proof test_results are being forged?
Cause 90% negative test_results dont make sense.
90% negative test_results make sense when you realize they’ve loosened what it takes to get tested, and a lot of people get tested saying they have symptoms when they dont out of fear.
You’ve presented me with unbacked claims of “the hospitals are full of people passing from lung disease and the test_results are forged”.
You’re peddling unproven bullshit about lung deaths not counting toward covid and forged test_results.
We have more negative test_results (69,000) than every state aside from NY.
And those test_results can still take a week to come back.
That means this person was able to meet the criteria to be tested, was tested, and possibly waited up to 10 days to get the positive test_results.
It can take up to 14 days for the test_results and up to 6 even if they hospitalize you.
It will speed up test_results time lol /s but yeah I see all the stuff that says it only takes 2.5 hours but yet I see it taking a week or more with some ppl.
Not surprising when it takes a week to get test_results.
4 deaths at my Florida hospital last night, all awaiting test_results.
Two weeks after presumably contracting it, I can’t get a solid test_result back.
Someone may be able to obscure test_results, but that won't stop people from going to the hospital.
I think it's entirely possible they're doing the most ridiculous case scenario of counting rapid tests towards the denominator of tests performed, but not towards the numerator of positive test_results.
You know, the test_results reported at the state level didn't occur on the day, or even the previous day, or likely even the last 7 days, right?
But  conflicting guidance from the Texas Department of State Health Services  created confusion among local health departments about what test_results  to report.
A reliance on faxed test_results has created a paper backlog  that makes it impossible for the state to do its own tally.
Local  health departments fax case reports to the state for each positive  coronavirus test_result, documenting on the form which kind of test was  administered.
On July 16, DSHS removed almost 3,500 cases from Bexar County’s case totals, saying the cases were “probable” and not confirmed because they were from antigen_test_results.
Local health departments fax case reports to the state for each positive coronavirus test_result, documenting on the form which kind of test was administered.
A reliance on faxed test_results has created a paper backlog that makes it impossible for the state to do its own tally.
People who work hourly jobs or are short on cash can't self-quarantine for two weeks over a mild cough ("Hey it's probably just allergies"), but I expect they will over a positive test_result they can get in the same office visit.
I know you aren't really saying this, but fewer cases as a result of people knowing they are sick sooner is not a reason to not report test_results.
If they aren’t reporting test_results for any legitimate reason, we should be outraged.
But even then it's only useful if you have rapid test_results.
test_results will show up 0-14 or more days in the past and deaths will show up 1 week to 3 months in the past.
You also are ignoring the fact that these tests takes ***48 hours to several days*** to get their test_results.
I'm not sure what the time it takes for test_results has to do with this particular conversation.
I'm referring to people that end up hospitalized, no matter what the test_results are that has been a pretty consistent % of the total infected, and an infected person will go to a hospital if they need treatment WHEN they need to, doesn't matter if the test_results take 2 months, they will go to the hospital when they are sick enough.
Because it takes AT LEAST 2 days to get a test_result back, and sometimes it's MUCH longer.
The antigen_test does take more time because it requires lab processing, but most people get the test_results back within a week, usually 3-5 days.
I waited 15 days with symptoms for my negative test_result to come back from CVS..
The problem with waiting to confirm the death, aside for the lag in time, was waiting on a positive test_result to match to the patient.
What bothers me is they keep trying to have people come in to work until their test_results come in.
San Patricio 33 / 0 / 20 (two weeks out and we're still waiting on test_results from the mobile test collection sites from Aransas Pass and Portland).
I'm sure everyone saw the uproar in San Antonio over these test_results.
She would need to self-isolate until the test_results come back, during which she will receive no pay and no support from the state.
All that being said, because of the delays in test_results actually hitting dashboards it's tough to say how accurate the Worldometers data is in relation to WHEN the trend actually started.
As far as a rolling average, yeah it's nice to see a rolling average because it smooths out noise in the numbers, but again we don't know how delayed these positive test_results are (IE- when the person was actually infected/tested positive) and the rolling average mainly serves to support a trend reversal early on, so when the trend holds it starts on the first day of the new trend not when the rolling average confirms it.
If you look at the Harris County Dashboard, they have an Epidemic curve, and it shows a peak around the first week in July which makes sense considering how delayed the test_results have been.
If you consider the US has had about 2M positive test_results in the last 6 weeks, and it takes up to two weeks for the average person to be considered no longer contagious....
Almost all of these reports have tests from various days included in them, it's really tough to take a single days test_results as the gospel with how messy the data is and how many conflicting charts there are.
Could be that its taking longer to get test_results.
The test_results are taking way too long for any meaningful contact tracing.
How are people in the public supposed to get treated if you can’t get a test_result back?
Both have still not gotten test_results back yet.
So, almost all people get test_results back and then go get treated.
Probably falling in line with reporting only PCR_tests, and removing the antigen_test_results from the numbers.
So not counting antigen_test_results as real positives and calling them as "probables" knocks off a couple thousand and more in the
The test_results are also taking up to 10 days in the major metroplexes, meaning that those who are careless and don't get their results for ten days are almost guaranteed to go out and about and spread the virus to others...
“Texas runs the risk of undercounting cases—and undermining trust—by not recognizing positive antigen_test_results, experts said.”
I'm more concerned that only 3 cities report positive antigen_test_results.
antigen_test_results will probably wind up back in the final numbers a few years from now as researchers study the this pandemic in the future, but they're permanently gone from our current numbers that are used for immediate planning and understanding.
Yes they were defined as "symptomatic cases that have a positive antigen (FIA) test_result."
There's tons of pressure by locals to "tell a better story" and "Well how many negative test_results are there?" and "Well how many are recovered?
Truthfully her symptoms may be gone by the time a test_result will come back right now.
The test_results are coming in about a week later than when the test was collected.
A more realistic criteria for recovered would be no more symptoms and get 2 negative test_results.
Those that test negative today may be positive 5 hours after the negative result, or even get infected while waiting for a result that comes negative and now they are a spreader with false sense of security since they have a negative test_result.
The fact that cases haven’t peaked yet could be because the bar closures and other changes weren’t enough to stop the growth, or it could be that as testing demand has outstripped capacity we are now getting test_results a few days later on average so the case growth may have peaked but incoming data is a few days old.
Then he said we had plenty of testing capability, even though today people STILL have trouble getting tested and test_results are delayed (he might have been referring to the NBA and NFL).
If these people don’t believe in test_results or COVID-19 being real, why bother getting a test?
I don’t think anyone gets a test_result that fast that I’ve heard of.
I’ve heard the test_results come back in three to five days.
test_results back faster.
According to the CDC: “Deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia or influenza deaths in the absence of positive test_results, and pneumonia or influenza may appear on death certificates as a comorbid condition.
That is respiratory infections are called until COVID-19 test_results come back positive.
While Travis County has seen a decline in COVID-19 cases in recent days, Escott says Austin Public Health is still seeing a significant lag in getting test_results returned so he doesn’t want the community to interpret the recent decline of cases “as a definite shift.”
try an open records request to get the data off the state computers, they are releasing an easier to read version of the summary of test_results.
This is 3 days worth of test_results (Friday-Sunday)...still high but not as terrible as it looks at first glance.
Not only is it increasing, but at least it looks to be following test_results, which would of course make logical sense.
My brother is awaiting test_results and I'm freaking out but I know if I tell husband he'll just say "oh he'll be fine" and brush me off.
Also, keep in mind that the daily reported cases are test_results from 5-7 days ago.
Remember that test_result reporting are lagging about 2 weeks behind.
I had silent hope these numbers were truly just an influx of past cases that were reported late or grouped test_results from mass testing of jails...
Instead of waiting for test_results just advocating quarantine for everyone that had contact.
But it shows the true curve not just the curve of the date test_results are returned.
I am a server in a restaurant that is not following the rules and having symptomatic people come in to work until their test_results come back.
The SARS-CoV-2 test_results turn-around-time is highly dependent upon demand.
Yep! They'll get their negative test_result, go about their business and infect everyone they come in contact with since they have newfound confidence from the test_result.
I hope you get test_results soon.
* In early May, the people who are given tests [weren't isolated while waiting for test_results.] Also in early May was [the first reported death.].
It takes about 3-12 days for symptoms to appear and another 4-7 days for test_results to come back.
Wife has all symptoms, chest pains, cough, breathing problems, negative test_results though.
Likewise, if you say you're gonna call someone about their test_results...
They figure the rates by test_results and days of the week.
My test_results took about 5 business days to come back due to current high demand.
I am guessing the right graph is "date of onset" or "date of test" where the left is "Date of test_result"
To see if we're testing enough, we can look at positive vs negative test_results.
And the store hasn’t even mentioned a new case of COVID happening and even said he was faking it before he got his test_results.
He is off today because his girlfriend who he lives with was exposed to COVID so they are waiting for test_results.
My husband's boss offered to have the company pay to quarantine him in a hotel room until his test_results came back so that, in the event my husband was positive, he wouldn't bring it home to pregnant me and our 2-year-old.
Probably depending on the lack of a positive test_results for that patient.
Are those cases for which test_results aren’t back yet?
That *might* mean the opposite, that a bunch of new covid cases have come into ICU, and they just haven't gotten covid test_results back yet.
Is that if you are suspected of having COVID they stick you on the suspected COVID ward until they get your test_results back.
Once your test_result comes back you are a confirmed if positive or a whatever if negative.
Don’t wait for a test_result to do this.
But the time after symptoms, then test_results back probably leads to Memorial weekend.
I talked to a got from Houston that waited 13 days for test_results.
Just turn around and tell them you are waiting for your COVID test_results and that they might want to stand back.
While many county leaders were grateful that Texas deployed coronavirus testing resources in their communities, others complained of a chaotic planning process and test_results delayed for weeks.
Your medical history and test_results can be shared with law enforcement.
Two weeks post test_result is what they are using.
You COULD be quarantined WITHOUT a test_result for 14 days.
Everything is delayed even test_results.
Yup, our office just got 4 new people out with positive test_results and active symptoms.
Then there's some serious lag between test_results coming in and them reporting it to the state.
Tell them you're waiting for your Covid test_results for you and your entire family.
Thanks! I’m always curious about individuals restaurants and their protocol around employees testing positive, but also the days in between an employee calling in sick and getting their test_results.
They are only showing new cases on the date the new case actually happened on, not the day they received the test_results.
Who goes to a party while waiting for their covid test_results?
She did not answer specific questions about how many of the tests or positive cases included in Texas’ count so far are based on antibody tests, why they are being included, or when these test_results will be delineated.
Testing numbers show the number of test_results for Texas residents reported to DSHS by public health and private labs.
**Edit for those who seriously doubt the antibodies test_results.
It seems counter-intuitive because of the comparison between the accuracy rating of the tests, and the author comparing the accuracy of only positive test_results.
***If you receive a positive antibody test_result, it has a 32.1% chance of being accurate***
But rather, don't take a single positive test_result to mean you are immune to danger.
Getting a positive test_result doesn't guarantee the presence of antibodies.
test_results?"  Oh, is it because he wants to threaten people?
I mean I get the sentiment, but it takes 2-14 days for symptoms to show, you usually have to schedule a test which could take a day or two and then 3-5 days to get test_results back.
3-10 days to get test_results.
The number of inmates who have tested negative for coronavirus is 478, and 46 inmates are currently awaiting test_results.
Sometimes there are people hospitalized for the symptoms and are still having a negative test_result.
However, their testing is not as clean as Texas as they are not resolving a test to a singular patient but just dumping all test_results into the pile.
**Total test_results in US 7,544,328**
Real timeline is: get virus, show symptoms, finally decide to go to doctor, get a test, wait for test_results from lab, wait for test_results to be reported by state - that does not happen in 5 days.
Not sure that one set of test_results should be extrapolated into a universal conclusion.
Cool, these are four sets of test_results with significant geographical separation.
Which strangely enough is super close to the serological test_results we have seen over the past few weeks.
And on top of that, its taking a few days to over a week to get the test_results back as well.
You do realize the test_results that get announced each day are not from that singular day?
This is test_results from about the last 21 days just announced yesterday.
Yet all three states have roughly the same number of positive test_results, despite the latter two testing far fewer people per capita.
Leaving out debate on the usefulness of OP's chart, the negative test_results are important for exactly your last sentence - it helps us determine whether, in a given sample, there are \*relatively\* more or less people testing positive.
If your test_results are that 30% of the population is positive, then you know it will be at least close to that number.
Takes 14 days to show symptoms, a week + to get test_results.
They were told by the testing firm just submit your positive test_results to your county health.
* Day 14-15 test_results come back unless you've been admitted to a hospital that can test at the premises, which means you're already in a bad position.
They are attrbuting the date of test not the date of announcement of test_result.
I said Texas per capita testing is pretty close to CA, and both states have very low rates of positive test_results.
It could be due to fewer test_results over the weekend, but they didn't drop as much as last weekend.
"Update: Just got tested! Still feeling sick but we have to wait for our test_results.
However, the general public is still somehow waiting up to 10 days for a test_result.
If it takes 3-5 days to show symptoms(then give or take some days till ppl finally get tested), then 7-10 days for test_results, it’ll be around May 1st when everything is back open.
I hope that everyone stayed home, social distanced during the Easter weekend, if not, then we can expect to see a spike in numbers starting mid-May, based on the current testing criteria and the time it takes to get test_results back.
There was reports of botched testing, never getting test_results back before it expired, etc.
Labs are required to send in their test_results for case count information.
That is why our rates, both for testing and for positive test_results, are low.
It’s not a surmise - if the population of infected is larger, then the rate of positive test_results go UP.
But I want to see us at a point where we have test_results in under 2 days and enough tests for a asymptomatic/suspected covid contact followup testing, where hundreds of companies are churning out ppe locally, and extra venilators are ready to deploy to outbreak areas.
**Laboratory Backlog:** COVID-19 Lab test_results Could Take 7-8 Days.
Due to an increased volume in the complex COVID-19 testing, the  laboratory has notified health providers that their normal 48 hour  turnaround for test_results has increased to 7-8 days.
The CDC backlog on confirming test_results is now pretty stable and has been for a couple weeks, so if the CDC had a huge backlog of TX presumptive positives they would have shown up by now as the CDC is handling the volume much better than they were in the beginning.
* There were fewer test_results this weekend than the previous single days alone, which likely explains why Texas had so few new confirmed cases this weekend.
Updated confirmed case information in Texas has ground to a halt over the past few days and I suspect it's a combination of severe lags in test_results coupled with a holiday weekend.
At least today is better, 9,000 test_results already in and likely more to come.
* Fewer new confirmed cases than previous weekdays, but far lower test_results coming in too.
test_results tend to drop every weekend, likely due to reduced hours at clinics or agencies reporting...so expect to see a big jump on Monday and Tuesday as they catch up.
But then there's the other part that has me saying "pull the other one" -- If previous test subjects have been waiting 2 days or 5 days or 10 days or longer to get their test_results...
My test_results were negative!
I'll add my test_results when I get them.
The relatively small number of test_results also means we don’t know which people had the disease and recovered (and how many people have recovered) and whether the projections being made with that skimpy data are accurate enough to guide our public health decisions.
Since it needs to be repeated: **This does not mean 90 percent of test_results are negative.** We really need the state to tell us what how many of the tests ARE negative, and how many are PENDING, so we can actually make informed estimates on what percentage may still turn out positive.
This does not mean 90 percent of test_results are negative.
The governor has decided the citizens of texas don’t deserve life much less test_results.
from all accounts, it takes 7-10 days to get test_results in Texas.
It's an utter failure, and why it's taking so long to get test_results is beyond me.
However bad it looks now, just remember that those numbers are around 7-10 days old (avg to get test_results back) and only from the small segment of those showing symptoms that were "chosen" to actually be given a test.
I know folks in Houston who had to wait more than 2 weeks for their test_results.
Testing increased from ~2k to 8+k in 2 days: he mentions we only have 300/600 positive cases (depending on source), but neglects to mention that test_results take (from what I’ve read elsewhere) 2-5 days to get results - so of the 6k new tests over the last 2 days, we’re likely still waiting in results for the majority.
By time you get test_results back it’s too late- they died before they can be confirmed positive.
Also, if someone dies while waiting for test_results, does this get counted as covid or "pneumonia-like illness"?
We can't even get a current number on positive test_results (ranging from 3 to 14 days for results).
Presumed positive was a thing when CDC confirmation of a positive test_result was needed.
The large number is due to delayed lab test_results?
The real case count for all counties is probably much higher than the known case count due to the lack of testing and the delay in getting test_results.
number of cases = (tested) * (1/6 severe cases get tested) * (1/5 infections are severe enough to test) * (3 week delay in test_results plus time to develop symptoms needing for testing: propagation of virus in three weeks with factored in social distancing).
I was just venting some frustrations with the amount of time it takes to get test_results and relating what happened to a friend when she got tested.
"A nurse in Texas told BuzzFeed News the lag is partly because test_results are slow to come back — the nurse said they have seen some patients either be sent home as they start to feel better or die from the disease before their results come in."
Tell them to contact the state health department and email them the test_results.
I have an update to share with you! The test_results just came back negative for covid for my boyfriend but the nurse and Dr are very very surprised it's a negative and said to assume it's positive and to continue our quarantine and his treatment.
Keep in mind, too, that in lieu of an official test_result of Covid-19, doctors can't just assign that as cause of death.
The five people I know in my city with positive test_results went to a private lab in a nearby city.
I learned today that he initially had a false_negative test_result.
A letter to the state stated over 60 pending cases (awaiting test_results) on the 25th.
test_results are coming back 2 - 10 days later due to labs being inundated.
Hospitals in Texas with admitted presumed patients are waiting 10-12 days to get their test_results back.
Take care of yourself and keep us posted on your test_results.
So far I've been linked to multiple cases of people with obvious symptoms having sudden downturns, often while waiting on test_results - which is completely unlike this case.
The other subject - Have to wait so long for the test_results is unacceptable here in Texas.
We are still waiting for the test_results.

Why are other states transparent with negative test_results, while in Texas it is a state secret?
A presumptive positive is literally a **positive test_result** that has not yet been independently verified by the CDC.
It does not take 1 week for test_results.
But even then, if you miss someone having the disease due to inconsistent test_results, or that 14-28 days, that “sterile quarantine” now becomes a death trap.
Risk is low, SXSW is on because they don’t believe that it’s going to create any risk for anyone (omg are you kidding me), and they’re still waiting on test_results for people in Austin but no hospitals directly have testing supplies.

An elementary school is a hot zone testing_site weeks before filling it with our children!?!??
Since this is at a school, it's probably a public testing_site.
The nasopharyngeal (back of the nasal cavity) swab is still the most accurate method, but unless you're in the ER with severe symptoms most testing_sites are not using it anymore.
>An elementary school is a hot zone testing_site weeks before filling it with our children!?!??

Check testing_sites at bottom of page.
That person remains asymptomatic, but the county testing_sites refuse to give them a test...even though they have direct, documented, long-duration exposure to COVID-positive patients.
The tests must be used at mobile testing_sites, Jenkins said.
If you're seeing different numbers it can be for many reasons--the state is running at least 24 hours behind in posting numbers, the news reports cases that may not be residents of that county due to limited testing_sites, and public vs private testing and reporting times to the counties varies.
Is there a way to find out which testing_sites are offering the Abbott tests in the San Antonio area?
Also I'll point out the spikeyness in data typically has more to do with the testing_site scheduling and human behavior.
Now, you can get one without doctor approval and claiming you have a headache (this is literally the criteria for the mobile National Guard testing_sites).
testing_sites are already starting to close around the DFW and they're talking about closing more because they don't have as many people wanting tests.
Plus we have the community testing_sites and hospitals and doctors offices.
So we are shifting from Phase 1: Only people who are sick can get tested (March) to Huge testing_sites with drive up testing (April), now to be more offensive and focus on searching out clusters and making tests available to people that couldn't make it to the testing_sites (hospice, children of parents that don't care, poor neighborhoods, etc).
Why can’t the state just set up a testing_site for the workers without involving management?
So if you read the article all they are doing is shutting down the mass testing_site hosted by the county.

If you are in a major city, there are no cost testing_sites but there are also public hospitals that will evaluate you, admit you if needed and provide care on a sliding scale for payment.
They were also supporting Fayette county, but Fayette opened its own testing_site last week.
Didn’t testing in this site just started yesterday?” “Yes, but is a new testing_site and they only have a few, I think 150 kits.
I agree, testing should not be so exclusionary and when there are enough tests and testing_sites maybe it would be prudent to have everyone tested to catch the asymptomatic cases.
Where I am you have to drive over an hour to the nearest testing_site.
We could drive 1.5 hours to a drive-thru testing_site, but you have to show three symptoms and he only consistently has two.

At a mass testing_site, probably Paris High School, cars would pass through a check-in point, proceed to testing and stick out an arm for a finger stick, pull forward and wait for results.
What I’d like to know if I’d have to walk to get to my nearest testing_site, or if there’s some other low risk way of traveling.
The Governor has ordered an initial focus on two critical missions that will directly benefit from Texas National Guard’s unparalleled logistics capabilities, medical expertise, communications support, infrastructure maintenance, and transportation assets: assisting drive through testing_sites and bolstering the state’s healthcare infrastructure.
Over the past week, Guard members have practiced erecting and running drive through testing_site locations alongside medical staff to ensure a well-coordinated process that allows Texans to access COVID-19 screenings in a safe, efficient way that also limits contact with potentially infected members of the public.
So maybe there is a FEMA testing_site, but for 90% of the population it’s meaningless.
We tested 12 people today at the testing_site.
At least ya'll have a testing_site.

Houston testing_sites were supposed to be ready and start today but aren't.
Abbott said the new labs and new testing_sites should start testing this week.
I did the Kroger at home test_kit 2 days ago.
I'm wondering if the at home test_kits are included in our numbers.
I mean, I thought we had insufficient test_kits and not enough testing machines this whole time?
Since you don’t have symptoms yet, perhaps try the at-home test_kit:
The real bottleneck is test_kits.
When the federal government distributed faulty test_kits in February, states were unable to monitor the disease’s early spread.
The  hospital system has space on the fairgrounds to see more patients but  is limited by the availability of test_kits.
You will be directed to drive-thru window to get a test_kit and instructions.
Getting reagents for test_kits doesn't solve those problems.
Explaining alternate reagents for test_kits doesnt solve those problems.
* Every element of our "test_kit" has been validated by Sonora Quest including the swabs we use as well as the transport medium.
This is the company that we are using to supply the antibody tests called [RayBiotech] It is their [Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Rapid test_kit] For a point of care test it is actually pretty expensive.
Plus we're having a shortage of test_kit components.
Right now, there's a shortage of test_kits, of protective equipment workers need to wear to do the tests, and also a shortage of nasal swabs.
There have been shortages of test_kits and machines and reagents to run the tests.
I hope we all now collectively turn that energy towards demanding more PPE, ventilators, and more test_kits for our state.
"test_kits and the chemical reagents used in the process are in short supply across the country.
The university has also begun to manufacture additional test_kits to help with current test_kit shortages.
The university said it has already tested the kits and determined that the process works. The efforts have been boosted by a $2 million grant to the university for testing and test_kit manufacturing.
The University of Arizona [said Monday] that researchers had produced 1,600 additional COVID-19 test_kits over the weekend and that the university's [Health Sciences Biorepository] had secured materials needed to make an additional 7,000 test_kits this week.
Using this formula, researchers initially manufactured five liters of the substance, which was enough for 1,600 test_kits.
In a [tweet] on Monday morning, Steve Voeller, the university's vice president of government and community relations, wrote that the test_kits would be used to help supply the university's campus health service, Banner Health and the Pima County Health Department. 
We need more test_kits, masks, gloves, medical equipment.
I think the state lab is literally running out of test_kits and cannot test many more.
I know someone personally that works at one of the major hospitals in Prescott and they said that they have zero confirmed cases and are not testing anyone because they haven't had any test_kits.
At this time, there are no test_kits for the coronavirus in Yuma County.
The Yuma County Health Department is working with the federal government to get YRMC test_kits; which will broaden and speed up the local testing process.
They told me that my patient did not fit into the category of THEIR specific criteria because they have so few test_kits available (specifically only “200 kits for the entire state of AZ”).
The fact that the state of Arizona has less than 200 test_kits and doesn’t inform private practice doctors, when a test is sent in, that they will not process it, is maddening.
I think it's time people start importing the home test_kits from foreign countries given incompetent the government seems all around.
There currently aren't enough test_kits for the whole country.
Until the production of test_kits gets into full swing - the test by necessity, will be rationed.
I've got news for you too - the overwhelming majority of other states are also having to ration test_kits.
There aren't enough test_kits to even test the people in the most hardest hit states right now.
So without enough test_kits yet - who are you going to prioritize testing first, someone with a high risk due to a known exposure, or someone with similar symptoms but no known risk.
After his administration has known since January that the deadly wave of coronavirus was going to wash ashore; after reportedly seeking to suppress the number of confirmed infections in the country by slow-walking test_kits to the states; after taking “no responsibility” for the spread the disease domestically; after telling governors they’re on their own if they need medical supplies; after having no words of comfort at a Friday press conference — Not.
Yes, LA, suspected fake Covid-19 test_kits.
Though pic shows bottled labeled as test_kits, not purified water.
Unfortunately, this is just the reality of the test_kit shortage.
Also many companies are hurrying to add this virus to test panels that hospitals already run, and companies are working at making at home test_kits.
In China when they ran out of test_kits the doctors were allowed to do clinical diagnosis.
Every single ER and primary care visit I asked to be tested for COVID, they declined, and eventually one ER doc confided in me that the facility simply didn't even have the test_kits but that they knew I had a virus other than the ones they tested for.
From the sounds of it, Hill Regional has few test_kits, and so does the clinic in Whitney, meaning they won't test unless you fall under [specific criteria]
Albert Hazzouri used his Trump connections to push FEMA to buy from his associates, including a promised 100,000 test_kits from Mexico.
Running out of test_kits and it’s becoming impossible in many areas to get tested as of recently as northern states are now sending us some of their supplies.
But seeing the long lines at testing sites and sites running out of test_kits each day tells us what we need to know.
However, at some point we will see a “peak” in daily numbers because we are running low on test_kits and they have had to change how/who they are testing to ensure there are enough kits for those who are showing symptoms.
That problem will only grow, as was warned yesterday by the test_kit manufacturers.
Because of the test_kit issues, the reported numbers will mean less and less going forward.
My worry is because of the lack of test_kits, the numbers will appear to be stable, or at a peak, whereas they could be double, triple, or much more if we had enough kits...
it’s possible the surge in cases is causing a backlog in processing the tests or causing some facilities to be more sparing with their test_kits.
Well the real problem is is that all of the test_kits that have either been purchased by the US or created by the US are showing false_negatives up to 30%.
From what I understand FDA eased regulations at one point so there are a lot of unreliable test_kits floating around.
That’s embarrassing for the time we’ve had, and seeing other countries have mobile testing phone booths, rapid test_kits, etc...
It did take the US longer than any of us would have liked, we lost about a month when the manufacturing process botched the first set of test_kits, and that's time we cannot get back.
TRUMP has said that Governors have thanked him for "doing such a great job," meanwhile governors and officials are basically smuggling PPE and test_kits to stop FEMA from snatching it.
Other countries took the issue seriously early on, and started working on producing/buying/using test_kits before we did.
**The CDC admits numerous test_kits are tainted, some with COVID itself.**
Well, if we are not secretly buying test_kits and PPE - we are screwed:
and we do not have ample test_kits or contact tracing teams in place in Houston to stop an all-put outbreak.
We are in a lose/lose/lose situation at the moment without ample test_kits and contact tracing teams in place everywhere.
cannot make these test_kits domestically in large quantities.
Indeed, the NYT says that many of the antibody test_kits are coming from China (and they don't work very well).
test_kits are still in short supply.
A) Must have ample test_kits and ability for people to easily get tested.
It also looks like they just [photoshopped their logo/name] onto a generic serological test_kit box.
There hasn’t been a magical infusion of millions of test_kits that the administration wants us to believe.
Corona test_kits?
Doubling every 5 days without having enough test_kits...
Like the mayor thankfully said, we need to at least 10 X the numbers because of the serious test_kit issues Texas has.
I'm SHOCKED I have not seen a petition floating around and getting TX media attention for hundreds of thousands of Texans saying "Hell no, we won't go" (back to work) unless there are ample test_kits for anyone to be tested at any time and hundreds of contact tracing teams (typically need 5 people per team as other countries are doing).
Without test_kits on every corner and contract tracing teams, millions will die in Texas alone by the time this is all said and done if the Gov has his way.
We need more test_kits ASAP.
Ultimately they need enough test_kits for proper contact tracing before they lift the stay at home orders or else we'll go right back to where we are now.
I read an article about faulty  test_kit.
[Faulty test_kits provided by China.].
That is referring to COVID-19 test_kits, not COVID-19 antibody test_kits.
I am waiting for the antibody test_kit.
His words do not give me [hope] His [downplaying in Jan/Feb] has left us  bereft of test_kits in Mar/Apr.
We are absolutely severely lacking test_kits.
Texas is not a priority for test_kits.
test_kits are being sent to hot spots.
My county has test_kits but refuses to test anyone.
TX says FU to Gov't and uses our power and resources to make tens of thousands of test_kits per day, scaling indefinitely.
At the end of 42 days, because of the ample supply of test_kits, PPE equipment for hospital workers, hyper-aggressive contact tracking and testing, etc.
Couple that with our test_kit disaster and constant lies....
it’s going to be a very long road until we get ample test_kits coupled with locking us down.
NYC is blowing past the initial predictions of their peak and curve and shows what much of the US is in for unless we lockdown and load up millions of test_kits so we can finally gain some control when we begin lifting the lockdown.
Unsure if that was a one-time thing or if it will always be there as long as they have test_kits.
**The FDA has** [NOT APPROVED] **ANY HOME test_kitS**.
The CDC rejected the WHO test and deployed an unverified test_kit.
However, my friend said the President can easily say that because the medical branch of the University does not have any test_kits for the virus.
They need to push for test_kits asap.
We don't have any test_kits and cannot verify or confirm whether or not patients have the virus.
than NYC is that they have a lot more test_kits to start to paint the picture of what is happening.
The option to order hand_sanitizer and test_kits, which we don’t have?
Will be a good indication of what is quietly happening in this area thanks to the city keeping info quiet and no test_kits until now.
It sounds like they're doing a pretty thorough investigation and hopefully some test_kits will be readily available for anyone they suspect might've come in contact.
I think it's just the staff is just hypervigilant and now testing (they must have test_kits now)  anyone with respiratory issues.
I'm just questioning your "WHO offered up test_kits in Nov 2019".
Blaming the head of the CDC for the chaos and not the incompetent President who fired the \[National Pandemic Response Team\](and has thoroughly failed at supplying enough test_kits to slow the outbreak.
But I think the problem is lack of test_kits.
CDC botched the test_kits and their algorithm prevented testing in the USA.
I have the same symptoms, for days now, i was a litttle sick like sinus with no mucus but with a sick feeling and horrible headaches, then i thought i was getting better and then the sore  throat started like glass in the lower part of my throat with a tickle that never went away, then came shortness_of_breath and then dry cough I started getting chest pains 2 days ago and its getting worse, I called a hotline in dallas they said i needed to get a test now, I'm un-insured so they told me that I had to call around to urgent cares and hospitals to see if they have a test_kit, been calling a bunch of places, no luck yet, one of them said to try fort worth, so i guess I'm now calling random places there.
And US reported figures are so absurdly low because even doctors that have tried to test very sick patients still couldn't get test_kits.
If docs in the ER can't get test_kits, nobody in a small town is going to have been tested in the first place so how would he know nobody has it there?
I have physical proof of the amount of test_kits ordered, as well as the order that Fort Hood itself will be a quarantine site.
Not enough test_kits, not enough transparency.
Evidently noone CAN do ANY testing because they have no test_kits.
Community Care IS dealing with private labs, but no test_kits to do tests with.
So even though test_kits are deployed, the private sector cant keep up with demand because there's not enough reagents to process the CDC PCR_tests.
* Lina Hidalgo states there is most likely an undercount of cases from community spread due to the limited capabilities of the test_kits
But I *also* think it’s (maybe primarily) to buy more time to allow hospitals to better prepare, and for manufacturers to ramp up production so hospitals can restock (and ideally stockpile) PPE, test_kits, vents, and other resources and supplies to hopefully catch up and get ahead before the system becomes too overwhelmed.
test_kits seem to becoming more available.
First, we are producing all test_kits locally (within our country).
test_kits and the people and machines doing them are finite.
Do we have test_kits?
No test_kits means no flattening the curve.
I find the lack of test_kits disturbing.
Having labs that can process tests, is not the same thing as having test_kits.
test_kits are out now.
regarding what I posted about, because they do not have test_kits at the hospital, they took blood and sent it to the CDC, with the 2 being “presumptively positive” based on Egypt travel and the symptoms they were having.
Not doing so is putting millions of lives at risk - especially because we have extremely serious issues regarding test_kits.
Egypt has a big problem right now, with cases in other countries stemming from there -- they are flying blind, like we are, and have been, and will continue to be until at least the end of the week next week in the USA (if in fact they finally do get working test_kits out like they are saying).
Sadly, with no test_kits....
we are in a heap of trouble -- especially since it MAY be until the end of the week everyone has some test_kits.
If I was running the show, the entire city of Houston would be on lockdown right now -- until we had the proper amount of test_kits and dedicated areas to handle proper quarantine for thousands of people so we could quickly take action on new cases and pockets of cases that emerge.
Speaking of testing - Memorial Herman in The Woodlands does not have any test_kits.
Why do we need 600K or even 1M test_kits?
Over 1 million test_kits have been sent to state health departments around the country and we fully expect to see the number of positive COVID-19 cases dramatically rise in the coming weeks.
We have the test_kit issue to compound this problem, coupled with no transparency happening around us.
I hope UH and other Texas/US universities and colleges acquire the appropriate test_kits asap.
However, my friend said the President can easily say this because the medical branch of the University does not have any test_kits for the virus.
We are far beyond the window of containment, or even slowing it down thanks to the test_kit disaster that continues, not taking actions soon enough, the propaganda that the 'flu is worse', etc.
If cruises want to keep chugging along, then they need to start paying for airlifted test_kits, emergency evacuations, quarantines of their passengers, and the salaries of everyone who keeps having to jump into action.
Hording testing_kits can cause shortages - the government is already bungling testing, let's not make it worse.
All I know is that they've been pretty okay with letting staff/faculty get tested using the on campus saliva testing_kits and you get a result back in a day or two.
Because of the lack of testing_kits & delay in getting test results, doctors have been treating people based on symptoms.
To get quick results, you would have to order a testing_kit online.
10k testing_kits and one new machine is a drop in the bucket.
Lorenzo Sierra, whose districts all include Tolleson, partnered with the city to secure testing_kits.
Great improvement here and Im happy to hear this guy acknowledge that getting a testing_kit is only 1 tiny bit of getting tested.
“At present, based on our clinic’s experience, providers in Maricopa County appear to have a sufficient number of testing_kits to meet current demand.
In the video, you explain there is no shortage of testing_kits.
How is it this office appears to have access to an unlimited supply of testing_kits yet AZDHS says there is a statewide shortage?
I also suspect Arizona burned a lot of their testing_kits by aggressively contact tracing at the onset of the first couple cases.
Tempe officials said more data on how widespread the virus is in the city could help staff better deploy protective equipment and other resources, access testing_kits and better prepare first responders and health care workers to handle the outbreak, said Rosa Inchausti, director of Tempe’s Strategic Management and Diversity Office.
In Flagstaff, Coconino County officials shut down one of two coronavirus testing sites this week because of a lack of both testing_kits and personal protective equipment for health care workers, spokesman Matt Rudig said.
Faced with a testing_kit bottleneck, health care officials and the state have lacked the ability to conduct widespread testing to screen for the virus, even among those who may be exhibiting symptoms or who are at risk already. If successful, ASU believes it could provide a crucial service that could start to turn the tide in fighting this outbreak.
I live in Prescott, and they've been open to the fact that they have hardly any actual testing_kits.
There just aren't testing_kits?
The officials have been pretty open with the fact that they possess hardly any testing_kits.
he built a fort out of testing_kits and a wall out of toilet paper.
If Trump would of accepted the help from the WHO and accepted the testing_kits that WHO was going to give us we could of gotten in front of the eight ball so to speak.
Austin mayor Adler said no testing for asymptomatic people a few weeks ago due to lack of testing_kits.
I keep reading about his strikeforce to reopen Texas, what about a strikeforce for testing_kits?
After the screening, and 30-45 mins waiting in line, same screening questions and the news, “sorry, there are no more testing_kits.”
Prob just to announce the new 5 minute testing_kits.
I thought that if we knew to have been in the same specific area at the same time, touching the same surfaces as a confirmed patient, maybe doctors would have an easier time prioritizing testing_kits for those showing symptoms, because the direct exposure would be known in those cases.
Low numbers of testing_kits restricted those who could be tested weeks ago and continue too.
It comes down to testing_kits and reagent bottlenecks.
Many of these testing_kits were flawed.
Where do you think all of the other countries got their testing_kits?
How much of an investment is needed to make a testing_kit?
We idiotically declined the WHO when they offered their testing_kits.
Most doctors and hospitals do not have the testing_kits, so infected patients are there, but they can't be reported without using those kits for confirmation.
Part of the reason the number of cases might be higher without people realizing it is because of the shortage of coronavirus testing_kits from the CDC.
I understand that testing is limited as there are literally not enough testing_kits/reagents to go around, but in absence of that, shouldn't medical professionals exercise an "abundance of caution"?
They're still lying about airport screening, testing_kit availability, who can get tested, the risk of infection, and basic statistics about this disease.
Abbott gets pissed off at a local government for wanting to regulate Uber or plastic bags or zoning vacation rentals but during a fucking epidemic he's all "you guys got this because local government is better than larger state and federal government let me know if you need more testing_kits we can get ya a dozen or so by April"
Then we learn we don't have any testing_kits, etc.
So testing_kits don’t seem to be the hold up now, but critical reagents for the kits are.
I've been told we only have 1 testing_kit for San Antonio, so how is this hospital offering screening???
It's most likely due to a massive shortage of testing_kits, but something definitely seems weird.
I just don’t think they are testing or have any testing_kits that I’m aware of.
There are no testing_kits.
labs have enough testing_kits--which supposedly will be in the next couple of days, unless the FDA is lying again--the bottleneck will be the number of labs/personnel that can do the tests.
Maybe because as many as 1/100 of these tests (approx., according to [the documentation] give false_positives (calculated as 1-specificity).
didnt Wuhan have a huge false_positive/negative rate?
This might be a dumb question, but false_positives would he a lot better than false_negatives right?
Yeah, I was going to say shit, it would be awesome if there was a ton of false_positives in there.
Ignore the worldwide reports of false_positives.
The biggest benefits are that it's sensitive and highly selective: it's unlikely to get a false_positive (unless there's contamination), but because you need to scrape the back of the brain to collect the sample, there's the chance of a false_negative.
false_negatives and false_positives are rather more likely than PCR, but the test can be substantially faster to perform.
Speed is important, but that false_positive and false_negative rate can be annoyingly high.
false_positives?
The limited reports you are seeing more than likely started with either an initial false_positive followed later by a true positive, or an initial true positive followed by a later false_positive.
The first test was likely a false_positive and they could've swabbed their skin and got a positive result.
they even indicate that there is a known false_positive and false_negative result possibility.
They've done it before (i.e., "We know for certain now this was a false_positive, so we adjusted the numbers").
No reports of false_positives.
Antibody tests tend to lean towards false_positives because there are other antibodies similar to Covid-19 that can trigger them.
The antibody tests (of which UA has produced 250,000K) are also reported to be flawed, often producing a false_positive result (ie antibodies present when there are none).
Now we know they are biased towards false_positive.
Does anyone know if the false_positive is generated because of antibodies to a coronavirus that causes the common cold?
And a few labs are being investigated for false_positives.
So I'm not going to take your claim of high false_positive rate as fact unless you actually have a source.
So, if someone got a "false_positive", and they were around 10,000 people, then it may be considered 10,000+ cases (based on "false" pretense).
The problem is that some people get lighter doses of this and show no symptoms, while many tests are not showing accurate results or false_positives.
Let's say it's double what he says, there are 40K probable antigen_tests that have been excluded, then that would mean we have performed roughly an additional 400k-600k tests, and our overall positivity rate would end up lower due to the false_positive the tests throw off.
But  according to the FDA, the risk is not that the antigen_tests will result  in false_positives — indicating someone has COVID-19 when they do not.
Lots of false_negatives and even false_positives.
The test being used is flawed and throws false_positives/negatives at a 40% rate.
That being said the false_negative rate with both are far higher than the false_positive rate.
false_positives are rare, usually only happen with lab contamination or data entry errors.
Like, when you get to be 50 and you have the option of a colonoscopy or "poop in the box," the box has a small false_positive rate for saying you have cancer.
There was a post just this last week about the CDC tests having a 30% false_positive rate and a 20% false_negative rate based on some UConn study.
Lab contamination was the cause of the false_positives, as you said.
Individual patients' symptoms, differences in the costs of the test, differences in the rate of false_negatives and false_positives of the tests.
This is even though the false_positive rate is very low - in other words, a positive antigen_test is almost surely a positive result.
I mean in McLennan we're sitting at 24% AND that's with using the antigen_tests known for false_positives 20% of the time for the last week.
For example, let’s assume you have a disease where the test has a false_positive rate of 1% (and no false_negatives), but only 1-in-10,000 people actually have the disease.
Covid has an estimated 15% false_positive rate  ND we've tested 35 million people.
That's 5 million false_positives  as well as the fact that people who are tested while asymptomatic have a false_negative rate  of 38% when accounting for those asymptomatic in the entire sample size we now a conservative estimate of about 25% of people being tested getting the wrong result.
The more tests we do the more false_positives there will be; its a guarantee  that that number will continue to increase as testing does.
Or the blood test was simply a false_positive.
The reason your leaving it is cause you think an 8% false_positive in clam tests means the same shit for corona virus.
The CDC says the probability of false_positives for antigen_tests are very low.
It could be that there was a false_positive test the first time or that she wasn't really over it and it stuck around for the whole time.
There was the potential for a false_positive due to the virus’ similarities with other respiratory infections.
Thus it's very possible it was a false_positive and she simply had a cold or influenza infection to account for the cough.
Please do not tell me it was because of false_positives.
Plus what is the false_positive rate of the test?
Some tests have a false_positive rate of 2%, which means half of those positives (which half?) would be wrong.
If they never had symptoms but are hoping to hear they are immune without illness, how do you know they aren't one of the false_positives?
false_positives will be a concern with that one.
Right now the odds are far greater that you will receive a false_positive than a false_negative antibody result.
Like I mentioned above, I would get the test done again because false_negatives are a lot more likely than false_positives.
If only one of them does, then that may mean one was a false_positive.
**"Of the 12 antibody tests that were studied by the COVID-19 Testing Project, one of the tests gave false_positives more than 15% of the time, or in about one out of seven samples.
Three other tests gave false_positives more than 10% of the time.**
I believe they were doing it, I just don't think there was any sort of conspiracy behind it especially considering all the false_positives the tests throw off.
The antibody tests have a high rate of false_positives, you'd think they would only include that data if they had a high rate of false_negatives.
And, none of this even bothers mentioning that the antibody tests throw off a lot of false_positives which would INFLATE the infected numbers.
And, with such a high percentage of false_positives on the antibody tests it's really boosting the infection numbers making it look worse than it really is!
With all the false_positives it will drive up the absolute number of positives, but it's very likely to also drive down the % positive against total tests administered.
The worst thing they could do is report a bunch of false_positive antibody tests making people think they're in the clear.
2) What is the false_positive rate of the test used?
Some of the tests have had 12% false_positive rates.
The best ones have had a 2% false_positive rate.
It's more like [15 % false_positive according to these guys] and only for some brands.
Regarding the efficacy of the tests, all I know is the city of San Antonio has rejected multiple antibody tests as recently as this past week because they fall below (sometimes well below) 85% or generate too many false_positives.
A false_positive for an antibody test (as compared to a false_negative)  is especially bad because someone would think they are safe or immune when they are in fact not.
If you know there's a 10% false_positive rate, then any given test is relatively unreliable.
But that false_positive rate can be accounted for if you do 10,000 tests.
Additionally, if you do 2 antibody tests a week apart, and they're both positive, then a 10% false_positive rate drops to .1%.
You realize how many of those antibody tests throw off false_positives?
The real question is how does the rate of false_positives and false_negatives compare.
There have been reinfection cases reported but they are unsure if it is a false_positive, or if it really can reinfect people.
The reinfections we saw earlier last month from Korea were all from false_positives.
Out of X number of tests run, in addition to "positives," some tests may be inconclusive, some results might be pending, some are false_positives and some are false_negatives.
Kendall county jumped up and down a couple times based on what I assume to be false_positives.
Your mass testing has proven highly inaccurate resulting in a clearly intentional rash of false_positives.
If you have 0.5% false_positives and you are trying to establish that 0.6% of the population has antibodies then it could be off by orders of magnitude.
I've actually heard that antibody tests generally have higher false_positives, so I also doubt his claims.
Do different test have higher rates of false_positives?
My understanding is that if the results are false, it's likely that they will show false_negatives not false_positives (but take that with a grain of salt).
My understanding of the tests, there is potential for false_negatives, but false_positives are unlikely.
How many false_positives are we getting?
What is the probability of a false_negative or a false_positive with those tests?
What about the false_positives?
Testing is not perfect...too many false_positives picking up seasonal coronavirus that is not covid 19 so it can be a false sense of security if testing is ramped up.
Usually the false_positive rates on tests like these are minimal, but the false_negative rates are what's concerning.
Also have to take into consideration possible false_positives/negatives when it comes to testing.
Most of us have had Covid variants before & have antibodies that would show a false_positive with most C19 testing currently available.
It rarely gives a false_positive though..
I have not seen reliable reports of significant false_positive rates.
false_positives, negatives, and delay of symptom onset) are more or less constant so while actual numbers are not reliable, trends still might be.
In Korea and China what they did to combat false_positives and negatives was to ramp up the use of CT scans to look for COVID in the lungs.
Uninfectious virus) and made a false_positive.
I guess there been no announcement bc of the problem with both false_positives and false_negatives, so they run multiple tests on single patients and get conflicting results.
Appearing as more false_negatives days/weeks later.
I personally am more concerned with people swabbing themselves, not doing it right and then getting a false_negative.
false_negative.
Our testing is no where near where it should be and samples degrade in storage resulting in false_negatives.
You are also correct that there is a chance of a false_negative.
The Abbott rapid test is the one with some concerns over accuracy and false_negatives.
It is very much unlikely that a false_negative was returned.
So either something is working or we are getting a lot of false_negatives.
is they’re not stored properly false_negatives increase 🤦🏼‍♀️
false_negatives are common and I’ve seen a lot of people go unpaid when they probably had COVID.
There’s a chance we’ve gotten a false_negative, but I feel considerably better in light of this.
Perhaps get an antibody tests to see if you had COVID and got a false_negative from the delay.
At that point I would have to consider the possibility of a false_negative.
Maybe we get some false_negatives, well we’ll catch them the next day.
if samples aren’t stored properly (-70C degrees)the tests are more likely to produce false_negatives....
This might be a dumb question, but false positives would he a lot better than false_negatives right?
I meant false_negatives.
The biggest benefits are that it's sensitive and highly selective: it's unlikely to get a false positive (unless there's contamination), but because you need to scrape the back of the brain to collect the sample, there's the chance of a false_negative.
false_negatives and false positives are rather more likely than PCR, but the test can be substantially faster to perform.
Speed is important, but that false positive and false_negative rate can be annoyingly high.
I wondered if I am in 30% of the false_negatives.
My fiancee and I, received false_negatives.
It sucks because don’t the antibody tests often give false_negatives?
There's a high rate of false_negatives with the swab test.
they even indicate that there is a known false positive and false_negative result possibility.
false_negatives only.
The larger set of quick tests, tend to generate more false_negatives.
I wonder if this was from when the CDC tests were faulty (i.e., giving false_negatives).
I'm beginning to think you're a liberal who is pretending to be a conservative based on every false_negative trope you believe about conservatives.
Besides the fact that antigen_tests only have a high false_negative rate.
The concern is that they are more likely to result in a false_negative —  meaning they fail to detect when someone has COVID-19.
Lots of false_negatives and even false positives.
My nephew had the test done last week and they were told by the doctor that it actually results in a ton of false_negatives.
The problem I see is that this test has a higher rate of false_negatives, which could lead to sick people going back to work thinking they are well.
From what I read, the antigen_tests are more prone to false_negatives, so they confirm the antigen_tests with a second PCR_test (although, I'm sure that's not being widely done, speaking from personal experience and other anecdotal accounts).
Because they throw off false_negatives, the state would be better off having these show up on the dashboard because they would actually decrease the overall positivity rates (to some extent), and they would also add to the testing totals in Texas (which would be a good thing).
It's possible as well to get a false_negative.
These tests aren't super great and especially the quick ones have a decent rate of false_negatives (you're positive but test comes up negative).
It's possible that you received a false_negative.
I was exposed at work by someone that I work very closely with and lost my sense of taste/smell for 2 weeks so I’m pretty certain it was a false_negative.
This is problematic due to false_negatives and not enough test availability.
Tests  have false_negatives.
It was negative but then they told me I could have tested too early or have a false_negative.
That being said the false_negative rate with both are far higher than the false positive rate.
false_negatives are very common, 20% at best and 100% if you get tested way too early.
Day 1: 100% false_negatives if you get a test.
Day 4-5: 67% risk of false_negatives, most people have symptoms onset, **infectiousness peaks.**
Day 8: Test accuracy peak at 3 days post symptom onset, false_negative risk falls to 20% (this is as good as the tests can get), but this doesn't mean you should get tested 8 days after exposure, it can vary because people have different incubation period.
Source: false_negative timeline:
The tendency in the medical community is to favor tests that produce false_negatives, but being accurate is obviously better.
There was a post just this last week about the CDC tests having a 30% false positive rate and a 20% false_negative rate based on some UConn study.
You were right about the false_negative rate as well.
Individual patients' symptoms, differences in the costs of the test, differences in the rate of false_negatives and false positives of the tests.
Your chances of testing false_negative is a lot higher now, see
Is it because of the false_negatives?
For example, let’s assume you have a disease where the test has a false positive rate of 1% (and no false_negatives), but only 1-in-10,000 people actually have the disease.
That's 5 million false positives  as well as the fact that people who are tested while asymptomatic have a false_negative rate  of 38% when accounting for those asymptomatic in the entire sample size we now a conservative estimate of about 25% of people being tested getting the wrong result.
The only concern about them is the high false_negative rate.
(Probability of false_negatives are high, so it’s a good idea to take the PCR_test if you feel that you actually have it.).
The Abbott test (named after the machine) also has a questionable amount of false_negatives.
The common [PCR_test has a 67% false_negative rate] in the first four days of infection.
I keep wondering about false_negatives.
But these are still producing alot of false_negatives.
It’s always possible that your results are a “false_negative”, meaning that you had Covid-19, but tested negative anyway.
There are numerous false_negatives even among people who tested positive for the virus.
We both got tested and both tests were negative, but the dr in the hospital told her it’s still probably Covid and mentioned the false_negatives.
I genuinely think we had it and got false_negatives.
Lots of false_negatives.
COVID tests are notorious about false_negatives.
Everybody knows that testing can have a high false_negative rate.
It's been shown that testing too early has a higher false_negative rate, however her husband was tested multiple times over several weeks.
The tests can give a false_negative sometimes, so y’all are doing the right thing by isolating.
false_negative seems to be the new trend.
We also had head of the CDC Dr Robert Redfield give testimony in February to congress stating the initial detection tests were shit that they were producing false_negatives.
maybe a false_negative, i dunno, but I find it hard to believe that she suddenly got pneumonia out of nowhere during the middle of a global pandemic.
I think it may be happening but not reported as such because of the tests that are false_negative.
Her test was negative but he believes it was a false_negative.
He thinks the test was a false_negative.
There are so many false_negatives and people do not administer them correctly often.
Friend will need to quarantine until she get a test at least and unfortunately there are false_negatives, so if friend can, she/he should quarantine.
It would probably help if testing wasn’t a couple hundred bucks in my area, and that’s for a test that has a 20% chance of producing a false_negative.
Right now the odds are far greater that you will receive a false positive than a false_negative antibody result.
I know that false_negatives occur, but for both of us to get a false_negative that would be some really bad luck.....
From what I have read, false_negatives can happen.
Like I mentioned above, I would get the test done again because false_negatives are a lot more likely than false positives.
most tests have a high specificity rate so if you get a negative your probably negative (false_negatives are rarer with most tests) and a lower sensitivity rate so if you get a positive, it could be anywhere from 50% likely its correct and up depending on the test.
Like i mentioned, I think one of the problems with the antibody tests available is that they can produce a false_negative.
The antibody tests have a high rate of false positives, you'd think they would only include that data if they had a high rate of false_negatives.
Testing errors create false_negatives.
It's likely a high number of false_negatives.
I know for a fact that I was one of those false_negatives.
I think false_negatives are way more common than people think with these tests and it is artificially driving numbers down.
A false positive for an antibody test (as compared to a false_negative)  is especially bad because someone would think they are safe or immune when they are in fact not.
Well the real problem is is that all of the test kits that have either been purchased by the US or created by the US are showing false_negatives up to 30%.
After all the issues with the false_negatives for the  covid, how accurate is that test?
Because tests have a 30% false_negative rate.
There is a major problem with false_negatives, incubation time, and asymptomatic cases.
The real question is how does the rate of false positives and false_negatives compare.
The original general covid tests in the US had about 30 percent false_negatives from what I've read.
The problem also is that the test has a huge false_negative rate.
I wasn't aware of this and it's good to know about the large false_negative rate.
Negative result, but apparently the tests had a 30% false_negative rate.
Did you know there is a false_negative of about 30% of tests?
However some people have had two false_negatives and finally in the third do round were positive.
I’d think that even the 30% with false_negatives would spread it to everyone.
Out of X number of tests run, in addition to "positives," some tests may be inconclusive, some results might be pending, some are false positives and some are false_negatives.
Studies show the best most used tests have a 15% false_negative error rate.
An important thing to keep in mind when viewing confirmed case counts: FDA-approved COVID tests are currently taking up to 7-10 days to be processed (non-FDA-approved for-profit testing centers have faster turnaround but may be less reliable--the Abbott ID NOW test is apparently producing about 15% false_negatives).
some of this is because of false_negatives, but compared to some place like Louisiana where 18% of tests are coming back positive it does indicate that we are doing relatively better.
false_negatives are also a problem with the tests too.
It can be false_negatives with the test.
The antibody test is virtually 100% accurate for positive results, but gives back a significant number false_negatives.
Then judge issues with botched testing giving false_negatives.
I suppose if you think that over time we've gone to using tests that have a higher false_negative rate, and that the decline in positive cases and % of tests positive is because of that, then that would be a reason to not trust this source.
My understanding is that if the results are false, it's likely that they will show false_negatives not false positives (but take that with a grain of salt).
Current testing being developed and used causes some false_negatives and scalability issues, but it is better than nothing.
Two tests makes it less likely that both were false_negatives, but obviously it's still possible.
My understanding of the tests, there is potential for false_negatives, but false positives are unlikely.
That's just cases confirmed, which doesn't take into account the people who haven't been tested or false_negatives.
What is the probability of a false_negative or a false positive with those tests?
But she stayed sick and after her symptoms persisted for another week her doctor told her the test has a false_negative rate of 20-30% and said she presumed she had C19 due to how long she had been sick.
I thought you said you tested negative and just thought it was a false_negative?
My sister-in-law is a med tech and says the Abbott test has a 40% false_negative rate.
I'm not a doctor and I say the Abbott test has a 10% false_negative rate.
Yet providers have reported rampant problems with COVID-19 tests giving false_negatives, in which the virus is not detected even in an infected person.
A lot of false_negatives.
Usually the false positive rates on tests like these are minimal, but the false_negative rates are what's concerning.
I'm still waiting on results from a second COVID-19 test my doctor ordered because the false_negative rate on the current test is high enough that doctors can't trust negative results when symptoms match COVID-19.
FWIW, I've read that the test has a 30% false_negative rate.
My doc said the false_negatives are from not shoving the qutip far enough up the nose.
So, the PCR_test has about a 30% false_negative rate, that doesn’t necessarily mean 30k more positives, but 30k more potential positives.
If we assume that the 10% rate holds up across the potential false_negatives it’s likely 3-5k more.
now there is a good chance there are more false_negatives than accurate positives though as the PCR_test has about a 30% false_negative rate.
So there are a lot of other people who are not even in the count who may be false_negatives.
There's also a 15-30% "false_negative" rate on the nasal swab tests, so the number is likely that much higher from the get-go.
It’s very likely that up to 30% or so of the negatives are false as the testing being used has a huge false_negative rate.
but yah, that would be about 17k false_negatives.
Could you have gotten false_negative for COVID-19??
Beyond that, the test has both high false_negatives and positives.
You are right that China adjusted their approach to account for false_negatives.
As far as I know most places in the US are doing the 2 swab part to mitigate the false_negative issue.
I'm am so so happy to hear it was negative but you're right to be double cautious since so many have received false_negatives.
I learned today that he initially had a false_negative test result.
And then the false_negative is also a potential issue - but only a small part (likely).
If the nurses don’t know how to properly collect the specimen, you’re going to get a false_negative.
Yeah, [about that] Seems like there's a solid chance that up to 25% of that 90% is getting a false_negative.
“When diagnostic testing is negative, the possibility of a false_negative result should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19."
I think there was something recently saying there is a chance of like 30% of a false_negative?
Oddly enough my first test was a false_negative too.
Enough tests are showing false_negatives that everyone is supposed to assume everyone has it.
yes, as someone else noted, both the flu and strep tests give lots of false_negatives.
Rapid Strep tests are known for false_negatives.
25% of people getting tested will be false_negative and decide to do a cross country tour visiting every acquaintance they’ve ever met, how is that so different from not being tested in the first place?
Hate to be a downer, but the test has a high false_negative rate - like 10%.
As others have mentioned there are false_negatives but also who knows if someone could get infected after testing negatively.
Nobody mentioned retesting or that false_negative was even a possibility.
I didn’t know anything about false_negatives until I started reading some of the comments on my post.
But there is some non-zero chance of a false_negative.
State labs have confirmed it, and I doubt they'd get that wrong, but "presumptive" gives off the impression that it still could be a false_negative and also serves to confuse people who don't understand the difference between presumptive and confirmed positive.
I guess there been no announcement bc of the problem with both false positives and false_negatives, so they run multiple tests on single patients and get conflicting results.

While I'm putting the rest of my numbers together, I just want to toss out that over the last 5 days, we've averaged less than 10k PCR_tests/day.
This is the 3rd time in a handful of days they've reported a really low number of PCR_tests.

6315 PCR_tests.
Is there any chance you guys can look at the recent drop in reported PCR_testing numbers as well?
From what Garret has been posting daily, it looks like we were averaging 13k PCR_tests a day for the weeks of 6/21 - 7/5.
Then last week (7/12) the average was only 10,956 PCR and total PCR_tests dropped about 17k for the week.
This week our average so far is only 7,315 PCR_tests a day.
(I just took the total PCR_tests for the week Sunday - Saturday and divided by 7).

I basically don't know how top sections of cases from tests are different from the bottom section of PCR_tests.

12,000 PCR_tests were done yesterday -- on one of the days we hit 4K+ we had something like 17k-19k (don't remember off the top of my head, I  think it was a record number of tests processed in a day).
Then I subtract the serology positives from the total positives and divide that by the number of PCR_tests reported today to get a PCR positive rate.
All three reported PCR_tests over 17k.

Today's positives divided by today's PCR_tests.
The total percent positive is all positives divided by all PCR_tests, which makes it a useless metric for gauging how things are now.

I can't find a good explanation for the disappearing PCR_tests.
Yes and that would probably help explain the fewer PCR_tests, but the tests that are decreasing are from 3+ weeks ago, not recently.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing has remained around 15K again.
PCR_testing info and positivity on the third tab.
PCR_testing has remained around 15K again.
- Total % positive PCR_tests: 11.4%
- all cases (70,051) by PCR_tests (494,337): 14.17%.
If I divide cases for the week by PCR_tests for the week:
There were 2748 new cases out of 9917 PCR_tests.
We've only had two days so far with more than 15k PCR_tests administered (last Thursday 6/18  & Friday 6/19).
For the week of June 14-20 we averaged 12,775 PCR_tests per day.
- **Testing:** As expected, PCR_testing stayed steady (Good!) Again, one of the highest reported numbers for PCR_test volume (15,530).
15,530 PCR_tests reported.
PCR_testing info and positivity on the third & fourth tabs.
Is there a list for number of positive PCR_tests per day?
On that tab, I see total PCR_tests, tests reported yesterday, overall % positive, tests by county, tests by collection date, tests by age group, weekly tests, and weekly aggregate %positive.
Maybe I'm super blind, but I don't see "daily positive PCR_tests".
“PCR_tests by date of collection”.
But you are right, it doesn’t specify PCR_tests only.
The % positive for PCR_tests matches up with each individual day’s total(?) cases divided by PCR_tests done.
If I divide cases by PCR_tests:
- **Testing:** As expected, PCR_testing bounced back.
(Good!) This is one of the highest reported numbers for PCR_test volume (15,000).
In adjusting to just showing PCR_tests, that pushed our positivity into the 20-22% range.
Testing: As expected, PCR_testing bounced back.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing plummeted 7,000 tests since yesterday.
Is this a low number of PCR_tests reported today compared to the last few weeks?
PCR_testing plummeted 7,000 tests since yesterday.
I ask, because looking at the PCR_test results on the [dashboard] it looks like right now, last M-Th have already been more-or-less reported out, and these results are from F-Su (typically lower collection days) and a bit from Monday.
The PCR_tests are probably missing at least 3 times more than they are finding.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing shot up 6,000 tests since yesterday.
Even more concerning is the fact that that was only from 1100 PCR_tests....
- **Testing:** PCR_testing is down 4,000 tests since yesterday.
I only have three days worth of PCR_test info but a few days have fewer tests now compared to the previous day.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing is up by 1,500 tests since yesterday.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing is up by 500 tests since yesterday.
That’s an average of all the PCR_tests since March.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing is down by a thousand tests today, but still one of the higher numbers posted.
Man what the hell is going on in Santa Cruz, everyday over the past week has been 20%+ positive PCR_testing.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing is up by a couple thousand tests over yesterday.
The swab test is also known as the PCR_test.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing is up by a couple thousand tests over yesterday again! (Good!) This is one of the highest PCR_testing numbers reported ever.
Weekly PCR_tests are up to 15% positive so far this week.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing is up by a couple thousand tests over yesterday again.
(Good!) 2nd highest PCR_testing number reported ever.
I don't have an exact answer for you, but [here's a visualization] of PCR_testing volume and cases by date of test.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing dropped by a couple thousand tests over yesterday.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing went back up by a couple thousand tests (over yesterday).
- **Testing:** PCR_testing dropped by about 4,000-ish tests from yesterday.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing increased by about 2,000-ish tests from yesterday.
is the weekly percentage increase of positive PCR_testing results.
The dashboard is unresponsive for me right now, but early to mid May the positive PCR_testing results were 5-6%, last week that was 12%, and this week has been even higher.
So, the 8.1% is the overall average from the start of PCR_testing.
Arizona has done more than 320K PCR_tests and 8.1% have been positive.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing increased by about 3,000-ish tests from yesterday.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing increased by about 1,300 tests from yesterday.
The data is displayed on the dashboard in three ways: the number and percent positivity of PCR_tests, the number and percent positivity of serology tests, and **the number and percent positivity of PCR combined with serology tests**.
7.7% is the overall average for all PCR_tests since they started.
Arizona has done about 300K PCR_tests and 7.7% have been positive.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing dropped by about 1,300-ish tests since yesterday.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing dropped by about 3,000-ish tests since yesterday.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing increased by about 2,500-ish since yesterday (Good!)
- **Testing:** PCR_testing dropped by 45% since yesterday's all time high.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing has skyrocketed! (GREAT!) Up 9,000-ish tests since yesterday.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing fell by 1,500-ish tests since yesterday.
However, the percent of positive PCR_tests has been increasing despite the higher volume of testing.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing fell by 3,000-ish tests since yesterday, about a 30% drop.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing rebounded big time, shooting up 7,000-ish tests to nearly 10,000.
(Great!) This is the largest number of PCR_tests released in a daily report.
[About 1,000 previously reported PCR_tests have been removed over the last week] across pretty much the entire reported period; as a result, daily [PCR Positive Rates] are at their highest reported values for every single day between 11-March and today.
From what I’m seeing on their website, if we are using the % positive of PCR_tests as our metric, then that hit a low the weeks of May 3rd and May 10th at 5%.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing shot up by another 1,000 tests.
(Awesome!) This is the highest number of PCR_tests reported.
- **Testing:** Huge decline in PCR_testing, dropping by more than 5,000 tests since yesterday.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing ticked up slightly.
2nd highest number of PCR_tests reported.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing stayed level.
Even with increased testing the PCR_test percentage went up today, as well.
- **Testing:** PCR_testing scaled up again today by another 1,000 tests, likely from the last testing blitz (good!).
- **Testing:** Since yesterday, PCR_testing spiked significantly & Antibody testing dropped significantly.
I finally got my PCR_test results back (negative) from the testing blitz at Embry on 5/16.
- Testing: PCR_testing dropped by 25% over yesterday.
176,003 PCR_tests + 69,483 serology tests = 245,486 total tests.
- We had a big drop in PCR_testing since yesterday, about 25%.
We had a big drop in PCR_testing since yesterday, about 25%.
I got my antibody test result yesterday (negative), but I still haven't gotten my PCR_test result.
I suspect that my test was counted in the weekend numbers, my antibody result was counted in yesterday's or today's numbers, and my PCR_test result will be counted on whatever day the result comes back.
Waiting to get PCR_test back still.
Day over day, test growth is PCR_tests today.
PCR_tests are up 8%, Antibody tests plummeted by roughly 47%.
Checking the math of what they are reporting with the accuracy only to the tenth of a percent makes determining new PCR_testing specific numbers problematic.
4691 PCR_tests reported with 581 new positives.
Edit: with 101,125 total PCR_tests, and 10,526 positives, my math of 10,526/101,125 is 10.4% positive.
581 as a numerator represents PCR_tests + Serology tests.
Notice that the "Number of New Tests Reported Today" is 8,821, which is the sum of both 4691 PCR_tests and 4130 serology tests reported today.
Similarly, 10,526 total positives represents PCR_tests + serology tests total.
I can't find the values you should be using, but you should be using (number of PCR positive tests today specifically) / (4691 total PCR_tests today specifically).
You should also be using (number of total PCR positive tests overall) / (101,125 total PCR_tests overall).
Unfortunately they just report the sums of serology and PCR_tests in the 3x3 box grid, so you can't break this down from the given data above.
Per the lab testing page there have been 101,125 PCR_tests at 8.1%, that would be just over 8191 positive PCR_tests.
If you go to the site and select the laboratory resting dashboard, then select PCR_testing for testing type, the PCR only tests reported is 4,697.
What percentage of people in TX are taking antigen vs PCR_tests?
They've reduced the number of PCR_tests funded and thus given, and since the processing time for PCR_tests is so high, people are opting for the rapid tests.
They are considered to be less  reliable than the molecular polymerase chain reaction, or PCR_tests **—**  which are highly accurate but typically have to be shipped out to  laboratories for analysis.
When those are negative (of which many would be positive on a PCR_test) they are still considered presumptive positives until they are PCR_tested.
Low sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR_testing.
From what I read, the antigen_tests are more prone to false negatives, so they confirm the antigen_tests with a second PCR_test (although, I'm sure that's not being widely done, speaking from personal experience and other anecdotal accounts).
There are plenty of people that get the PCR_test (Abbott test) that get results back same day.
Quick antigen_test or PCR_test?
Next Level also carries the PCR_tests, they do look to be bogged down some.
Probably falling in line with reporting only PCR_tests, and removing the antigen_test results from the numbers.
Regarding the death reporting, one aspect I am a bit concerned about is if they are running covid PCR_tests on those that die at home or if they are not doing so by policy and then refusing to count them.
And apparently it has something to do with keeping the results consistent across the state as well as some guidelines from the CDC regarding reporting on presumptive positive PCR_tests.
The antigen_test detects a different part of the virus than the PCR_test, and it is FDA approved for this exact purpose.
Of the PCR_tests are so accurate (which for positives everything I've read says they are) then why doesn't the CDC change that guidance?
Tarrant had the excuse that they were defining confirmed cases as positive PCR_test AND completed investigations before CDC definitions came out, but there’s really no excuse for waiting still 3 months later.
PCR_test once a month plus any because of contact tracing (we are a fucking outlier I know) that in addition to other precautions.
(Probability of false negatives are high, so it’s a good idea to take the PCR_test if you feel that you actually have it.).
Our methodology of PCR_testing/detecting in the early/active stages of infection is severely limited, both by politics and the natural limitations of the tests used (sensitivity, specificity, etc.), and that isn't even taking into account the ENORMOUS gulf of asymptomatic cases that are simply never going to be acknowledged due to both unawareness of infection and the fact that our governments literally do not permit the testing of asymptomatic cases anymore.
The common [PCR_test has a 67% false negative rate] in the first four days of infection.
The PCR_test searches for 3 COVID-specific genes so its also possible he had 1 of 3.
Speculated the 5/1 drops might have been to indecisions/judgments made on including antibody tests, non-PCR_tests, and/or possible clerical indiscrepencies (site of test vs.
That site does only use PCR_tests not antibodies in their count.
The botched testing is more along the lines of mixing antibody tests and PCR_tests and that fact that commercial antibody tests are LFA stick tests with dubious accuracy.
But there's not much info on their methodology and definitions...was a PCR_test (active virus) or serology test (antibodies) for example.
I’m anxious to see how PCR_testing continues to develop over the coming months.
## This is serological testing for antibodies, not RT-PCR_testing for active infections!
So, the PCR_test has about a 30% false negative rate, that doesn’t necessarily mean 30k more positives, but 30k more potential positives.
now there is a good chance there are more false negatives than accurate positives though as the PCR_test has about a 30% false negative rate.
Reading r/covid19, I am seeing less value put on PCR_testing.
I believe China quit depending on PCR_testing as much at the height of the outbreak.
What likely happened is either these individuals had their viral load so low that they tested negative without actually being negative, or that the PCR_test only caught particles of remnant (I.e.
Quick tidbits: rt-PCR_test can be positive but an individual can be asymptotic, rt-PCR_test can be negative and an individual can still be infected.
So even though test kits are deployed, the private sector cant keep up with demand because there's not enough reagents to process the CDC PCR_tests.
Hope they arent planning on doing PCR_tests or its gonna be a fizzle.
Very stronk number with no antigen_tests everyone is taking now.
More people seem to be taking the faster antigen_tests.
According to this local judge I’d guess maybe 5-10 antigen_tests for every 1 slow test, at least for the rural counties.
Let's say it's double what he says, there are 40K probable antigen_tests that have been excluded, then that would mean we have performed roughly an additional 400k-600k tests, and our overall positivity rate would end up lower due to the false positive the tests throw off.
They also don't count probable cases from antigen_tests, which is valuable information even if they aren't 100% accurate.
Besides the fact that antigen_tests only have a high false negative rate.
If you test positive with a antigen_test YOU HAVE COVID, but if you test negative proceed with caution.
Not antigen_tests specifically, but antibody.
And  while there is no way to independently estimate the scope of the  undercount, based on the 11 Texas counties that publish antigen_tests  results separately of their own accord, the state’s tally is short by at  least tens of thousands of cases — but likely far more, a Houston  Chronicle analysis found.
The federal government is rolling  out a program to use thousands of antigen_tests in nursing homes across  the country — including Texas.
The  antigen_test was approved by the U.S.
But  according to the FDA, the risk is not that the antigen_tests will result  in false positives — indicating someone has COVID-19 when they do not.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  instructions, considers people with a positive antigen_test to be a  “probable” case of COVID-19.
Since most counties aren’t reporting the number of positive  antigen_tests results on their websites, the state has no way to report  the number publicly yet.
BD, one of the major producers of antigen_tests in the U.S., has distributed more than 750,000 of the tests so far.
Yeah, I just checked 1point3acres, and sure enough, the numbers for my county (Taylor) don't include the 600+ antigen_tests (which accounts for more than a third of our cases as reported by the city website).
On July 16, DSHS removed almost 3,500 cases from Bexar County’s case totals, saying the cases were “probable” and not confirmed because they were from antigen_test results.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instructions, considers people with a positive antigen_test to be a “probable” case of COVID-19.
Where did you find the antigen_test info?
They're also doing about twice as many antigen_tests as the other type.
They also list 589 "probable positives" from antigen_tests (which comprise almost 2/3's of tests being done lately).
This leads to the one logical reason to not include PCR and antigen_tests.
There are many instances where antigen_tests are used to get a rapid response to detect the most probable infectious people as quickly as possible (before surgery).
I’d say the antigen_test is currently outperforming the ID now.
The states that do report the antigen_tests apparently put them in a probable category (by in large), and from what I read Texas is also looking to reconfigure the reporting to include a probable category rather than just positive/negative.
From what I read, the antigen_tests are more prone to false negatives, so they confirm the antigen_tests with a second PCR test (although, I'm sure that's not being widely done, speaking from personal experience and other anecdotal accounts).
What matters here are the trends, like positivity rate, number of new positive tests, hospitalizations going up/down, ICU going up/down, eliminating the antigen_tests does not cover up any of these trends to any significant degree.
The 13X number, from what I have read, takes into account all the people that either have minor or no symptoms and never get tested, no so much the antigen_tests.
Keep in mind, I agree the state should count the antigen_tests, every state should, that's why a national standard for any future epidemics/pandemics would be most helpful.
The antigen_test does take more time because it requires lab processing, but most people get the test results back within a week, usually 3-5 days.
Quick antigen_test or PCR test?
Majority is probably #2 which includes the fast 15 minute antigen_tests.
Bexar county, which is the only other county that I know of that reports probable cases says they only include positive antigen_tests.
Probably falling in line with reporting only PCR tests, and removing the antigen_test results from the numbers.
This is even though the false positive rate is very low - in other words, a positive antigen_test is almost surely a positive result.
I totally get why they removed the antigen_test - trying to keep numbers low.
So not counting antigen_test results as real positives and calling them as "probables" knocks off a couple thousand and more in the
I mean the state doesn’t even include the fast 15 minute positive antigen_tests.
I read they’re only one of three counties that report the antigen_tests in the state.
“Texas runs the risk of undercounting cases—and undermining trust—by not recognizing positive antigen_test results, experts said.”
I'm more concerned that only 3 cities report positive antigen_test results.
The CDC says antigen_tests are valid for determining COVID status, so the only thing that the state accomplishes by doing this is to artificially deflate our COVID numbers, just as they are doing by pretending excess deaths are not COVID-related even though they are.
The antigen_test detects a different part of the virus than the PCR test, and it is FDA approved for this exact purpose.
Other states include antigen_tests in their numbers specifically because it actually detects the virus itself, and does so with very high accuracy.
The multiple experts mentioned and quoted in the article suggest keeping the datasets separate for research purposes, but were all disturbed by the elimination of the antigen_test datasets from the numbers being reported to the public.
What leads me to believe that antigen_testing results won't make it into the final public numbers is the fact they were removed, and there's no practical way to go back and retest those patients with PCR.
I thought those 3,484 were antigen_tests?
I mean in McLennan we're sitting at 24% AND that's with using the antigen_tests known for false positives 20% of the time for the last week.
Did y'all read the part about the DHS removing from the tally those who tested positive on the antigen_test?
It’s not the only definition, but most probable cases are positive antigen_test since definition #1 requires contact tracing and #3 is for deaths.
Many don’t even know the rapid 15 minute test they’re taking is an antigen_test.
Positive lab results from the fast 15 minute antigen_tests that many are taking now aren’t included in the numbers because they’re considered probable cases (#2).
Bexar county which does include probable cases says probable generally means that there is a positive antigen_test (#2).
I don’t see the reason for not including probable cases when there’s a positive antigen_test.
The CDC says the probability of false positives for antigen_tests are very low.
I paid $200 out of pocket without insurance for a rapid antigen_test in Denton this week at Minor Emergency of Denton.
I’ve also seen something called an antigen_test they are working on.
Where do I get a good coronavirus antigen_test??
At this point we also really need the antigen_tests so we can figure out how many have already gotten it and recovered.
So we need both: a rapid antigen_test to look for current infection, and antibody tests so we can study how many people already had it and whether / how long immunity lasts.
If true, that’s the best outcome with a widespread antigen_test.
Testing is the first thing that has to happen for containing the spread.
With no proper testing numbers, all the other metrics became questionable in my opinion.
If we keep having 7k total testing days with 1k infected, this most likely means demand is low and people just arent getting sick which is reflected in the hospitalizations being down.
Its not that testing locations have really decreased.
You can locate testing sites.
Some places are planning to require weekly/monthly tests, but that will artificially inflate numbers (same group testing repeatedly).
Phase 3 trials will expand testing to more at risk populations such as the elderly and other groups with comorbidities.
I have not read of any testing with children.
- **Cases:** Good drop in % of positive tests today, but low testing numbers again.
- **Testing:** Similar low testing numbers as yesterday, 52K tests shy of 60K.
Can't help but notice that testing numbers are trending downward lately.
- **Navajo: 1 in 21.0 people** (I don't think this includes tribal testing).
Hi, [Here is a screen grab] of my spreadsheet on the testing info for the backlog.
You aren't going to see a big jump of 60k tests in a day since their testing capacity is somewhat throttled.
There does not appear to be demand for that amount of testing though right now.
I think you’re right but they still need to increase testing capacity to be prepared for a future spike (even though I personally think that’s unlikely).
You think the spike is unlikely or you think the increase in testing is unlikely?
- **Cases:** 50% drop in positive cases today (but big drop in testing as well).
- **Testing:** 7K-ish drop in PCR tests since yesterday, 52K tests shy of 60K.
How’d retesting go (if you don’t mind sharing).
We really need to increase the testing.
ARIZONA NEEDS MORE AND BETTER TESTING!!!!
Large decrease in patients with minor symptoms presenting for testing.
You can't really limit churches without running into First Amendment issues if anyone makes a point of contesting it.
\-Our confirmed cases plummeted because our testing plummeted, hospital capacity is steadier (but maybe slightly declining).
I understand the general skepticism on it due to the testing backlog, but to me, the story checks out.
We've had zero guidance on how to react, incomplete/irrelevant/unreliable data and poor testing response that has left us all faithless.
- **Testing:** 5K-ish decrease in PCR tests since yesterday, 45K tests shy of 60K.
- **Navajo: 1 in 21.1 people** (I don't think this includes tribal testing).
We are being told that there just isn’t as high of a demand for testing at the moment, yet the percentage positive gives the indication that we aren’t testing enough.
They were doing testing @ South Mountain Community College and had high turnout...suddenly it’s been moved to Caesar Chavez Park.
The tents are in the backend...and there is NOT ONE sign indicating testing.
The park is very popular on holiday weekends n they bring out those traffic led signs to tell ppl they can’t park in certain areas for fucking Easter...but no such sign for the testing.
Accounting for just these 3 factors will cut your testing population quite a bit already.
I wonder if this is because of the testing backlog?
I think the real issue at hand is, short of hospitalizations and deaths if people are getting testing fatigue and not going to go get tested we have no indicator of the spread school has caused once they open.
So testing will be limited to those who either are getting tested with out symptoms or symptomatic people in a higher %.
I understand the skepticism with the testing backlog, but I personally don't have much trouble believing that the virus really is receding in Arizona.
Despite the testing backlog, I don't find it particularly hard to believe that mask mandates and bar closures did exactly what you'd expect mandates and bar closures to do, in exactly the amount of time you'd expect them to do it.
Hording testing kits can cause shortages - the government is already bungling testing, let's not make it worse.
Testing once a week sounds like a terrible drag to me.
- **Testing:** 8K-ish increase in PCR tests since yesterday, 40K tests shy of 60K.
Is it that these are people retesting ?
This was on Sonora's website yesterday which migh explain the jump in testing:
- Two new testing lines are in production and our testing ramp up will continue to accelerate as we add an additional line, which is in the process of being validated and should be in production by July 31.
- Starting Monday, August 3, testing on the new lines will be reported within 1 to 3 days, with an expectation to be reported within 1 to 2 days by the end of August as additional lines are put into production.
- As the additional testing lines are implemented and staff trained, Sonora Quest anticipates that it will be close to a capacity of 21,000 tests/day by Monday 8/3, and a capacity of 30,000 by Sunday 8/9.
Capacity will continue to increase as we add additional testing lines until we reach a capacity of 60,000 tests/day by 8/31.
[Mike Osterholm's podcast] gives some good information about testing at about the 52:36 mark.
TLDR: The US hasn't had a nationally coordinated response to testing, so private companies have had to develop their own response.
Other countries that are doing higher volume of testing are actually using a lower tech approach that is more scalable.
If you're interested in testing, I highly recommend listening to the [This Week in Virology interview with David Mina] David Mina is a Harvard epidemiologist who has been researching approaches to cheap, fast testing to the tune of $1 per test, one hour to process it at home.
Testing is all but worthless with the processing time we've had.
Hopefully we can have efficient testing and processing happening at the same time soon, so people can can have confidence in it for once 🤞🤞
Maybe at the end of August if our testing turnaround keeps up it’ll be a truer measure.
Well, the only reasonable conclusion anyone can draw from test data about trends is "testing is all fucked up" - we're just *finally* through the backlog from the second week of July enough to kind of trust it, and given that new cases peaked on July 2nd, that's kind of the minimum to be able to see a real decrease.
[NPPTL Testing].
Well the free testing certainly wasn’t followed through because I haven’t heard of it until now and know people who have paid for testing.
1ST CARE FAMILY MEDICINE in Mesa has 24hr turnaround testing, accepts all insurance and has a cash pay price.
since the testing is so backlogged this doesn't really portray an accurate picture.
\- The data would need to be properly backdated, given the lag time and other issues with testing, perhaps it already is.
Also, our testing is down compared to weeks prior....
I'm not going to say this is unequivocal because there are other variables that could influence the reported infectiousness including social behaviors and reporting/testing issues.
“If we did a mass testing campaign on 300 million Americans right now, I think the rate of asymptomatic infection would be somewhere between 50% and 80% of cases." Gandhi says.--
Sonora has not ramped up their testing.
Let’s guess how he’s going to explain(spin) the testing not being at 35,000 per day.
His "testing by day graphic" he flashed was REPORTED tests, not the day the test was administered.
Testing numbers are 20k+ below what should currently be, Schools seemingly are on their own as far as figuring out when and what they have to be doing for the upcoming school year, our hospitalizations seem pretty constant.
- Large manipulation of the numbers to make it look like we are in a good way with our cases, even though our testing backlog is among the largest in the country and we are the epicenter of cases per capita.
Sonora quests website has a good statement about testing increases.
Sonora Quest has made significant progress on the testing backlog, reducing it by more than 30,000 tests over the past several days.
Our utmost priority is focusing on our backlog of testing and we expect to clear the backlog by Sunday, August 2.
Two new testing lines are in production and our testing ramp up will continue to accelerate as we add an additional line, which is in the process of being validated and should be in production by July 31.
Starting Monday, August 3, testing on the new lines will be reported within 1 to 3 days, with an expectation to be reported within 1 to 2 days by the end of August as additional lines are put into production.
As the additional testing lines are implemented and staff trained, Sonora Quest anticipates that it will be close to a capacity of 21,000 tests/day by Monday 8/3, and a capacity of 30,000 by Sunday 8/9.
If you stop testing, you won't have bad test results?
Better start testing now, or hopefully they have their own lab.
Well ASU is offering free of charge testing.
Testing is a joke at this point for anything other than rough idea statistics.
The university houses a fully CLIA-certified* and FDA Emergency Use Authorization approved testing lab at the Biodesign Institute to perform a diagnostic qPCR test for those individuals who may have an active coronavirus infection.
The ASU clinical testing lab has implemented testing for frontline health care workers, first responders and critical infrastructure employees since April.
ASU will now provide a saliva-based COVID-19 test and will prioritize testing for any student or employee who is exhibiting symptoms or may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.
ASU has COVID testing labs.
Me and my colleagues all got results within 24 hours of testing.
No true, as an employee I was told we have testing available but it is not required to return.
Students living off campus aren't required to have a test, but testing will be available to them.
- **Testing:** 1.5K-ish increase in PCR tests since yesterday, 23K tests shy of 35K.
Are these slightly lower numbers (compared to the continual 3k+ days) representative of an actual decline, or is there still plenty of shitfuckery going on with enormous testing backlogs?
I wonder if the uptick in er visits has something to do with lower testing at the state blitz sites.
The only way that the Sonora Quest backlog numbers make sense to me is if testing locations are sending many (most?
Also testing is also down, some attribute that to all the stories of the long lines, running out of testing materials, and long waits for results.
I am hopeful that here in a week or 2 our testing will be good and we can continue to get this under control.
These geniuses who want to send their kids into my classroom are largely gathering and protesting with no mask on.
"The state won't let me murder my neighbor for letting his dog crap on my lawn, so we're here protesting.
- **Testing:** 2K drop in in PCR tests since yesterday, 24K tests shy of 35K.
The testing numbers are still surprisingly low which is skewing our Rt, again.
I’ve heard some opinions that testing is worthless if it takes 14 days to get results so people are just not testing.
I work for an Urgent care and we saw a huge drop in patients looking for coronavirus testing starting this weekend and so far, continuing through the week.
Saw a testing station completely empty.
He didn’t follow through on testing promises.
/u/dchapman77 Hey, I think you were the one who mentioned the other day that the hospitalization data is more real-time than the testing and thus more reliable, but then I see stuff like the above two comments and I have seen this sort of claim elsewhere about a lag in hospital reporting.
I did the testing with Embry Health and they said 3-5 business days.
The backlog makes contract testing impossible.
For a hospital system around North Phoenix/Scottsdale, they are converting their covid testing center back to a regular medical office.
I hope so! I wonder if testing will go up once people realize they don’t need to wait 7+ days (I know it’s more like 10+ but I’m trying to be generous).
I believe the super long delay is directly related to our low testing turnout, which in turn lowers our reported numbers.
And then a group of Karens were protesting at the capitol to be able to send their kids to in person schooling in August.
It's pretty fast, 4hrs or so to run, and it seems like most testing companies have been running into backlogs with this test because it is the preferred test.
That may be because the testing companies are swamped and there have been a lot of technical errors reported.
For the rapid testing they're using a test created by Assure.
This might not be the right testing for your application because it's probably not going to tell you any early stages of infection.
Overall though the company is legit and so is the testing.
Also travelbug in Scottsdale is offering the same kind of testing I'm not really sure what their rates are but you might want to start looking around for competitive pricing?!
I got tested the other day because I was getting a bunch of other regular testing done with a negative result.
- **Testing:** 1.5K-ish increase in PCR tests since yesterday, but still 22K shy of 35K.
Our testing is no where near where it should be and samples degrade in storage resulting in false negatives.
For example, if you get tested on Jul 1, and your test is reported out on Jul 10, then you're reported out in the Jul 10 summary (the reported "new cases" number), but the lab testing and confirmed cases tabs backdate your test to Jul 1.
Widespread testing is only now becoming available throughout the community.
Despite the availability of widespread testing, obtaining test results in a timely manner to allow effective contact tracing does not exist at this time in our communities.”
They were one of the states with the biggest breakouts early on (I think they were top 5 at one point), but they immediately shut everything down, reopened slowly based on testing data, and now I think they’re #27 in terms of number of cases.
[not a comic book but Denmark] did random testing and found 1.1% of the population have antibodies, though only 0.2% of the population officially tested positive.
What are your thoughts on the latest of news of Miami Marlins players/coaches testing positive for COVID-19?
Try the ASU saliva testing.
They use that at their "community testing sites" stated in their FAQ here:  #acnfaq]#acnfaq)
Rapid-result testing is generally returned in person within 30 minutes of specimen collection.
COVID PCR testing is is the type of testing collected by CVS.
I just wonder if they reported someone else’s test to my chart, because I find it hard to believe they would turn it around that quickly given our current situation with testing.
I've been making cotton batik/chiffon masks (batik is higher thread count, chiffon provides some electrostatic barrier properties according to a [University of Chicago study] from the [Suay pattern] which was designed with mask testing equipment and features elastic on all four edges to give a better seal than most homemades.
- **Testing:** 2K increase in PCR tests since yesterday, but still 24K shy of 35K.
Are things getting truly better or is this simply a matter of less testing/backlog?
Also, a lot of people probably assumed the free testing clinics would be another 12 hour wait in summer heat to eventually be turned away anyway due to running out of tests, even though the Federally backed ones are actually really fast with wait times.
Serology tests * last week's serology positive rate from the laboratory testing tab.
In Arizona, Sonora Quest Laboratories offers testing that you can purchase through My Lab ReQuest™.
Also, with a 60,000 - 85,000 testing backlog, how can we know where we are really?
It is a little hard to take much stock in raw testing data, knowing the problems testing in AZ has had.
Testing is a major problem for sure.
I can’t believe your coworker refuses testing ughhh.
Pretty short-lived testing backlog catch up.
- **Cases:** Lower case report today, due to lowered PCR testing.
- **Testing:** 11K drop in PCR tests since yesterday.
Does anyone ever confront him about the absolute shitshow of testing under his watch?
Nah his excuse will be testing demand dropped so Catapult was dropped.
25% positive rate, but yeah, nothing to see here - testing plenty.
The pics of hours long waits, two week delay in reporting and work being upset you’re taking time off (along with not having PTO) most likely also have something to do with testing demand being down.
They also don’t advertise which days they are testing where, at least for the employee tests, so you have to continually check.
Testing is required for students in on-campus housing.”
Lol assuming that we have a plateau (or even anything conclusive about the geometries of our infections vs time curves) when we know we have grossly inadequate testing.
I've seen a lot of skepticism about whether our situation is truly improving or not due to the insufficient testing going on, but for myself, hopefully without being too blindly optimistic, the situation seems to all add up to me.
The number of new cases can depend on testing, an issue Arizona has struggled with, but the number of people hospitalized with the virus — a real-time measure of who is seriously sick — has also started to decline.
High positive test rates can indicate insufficient testing, experts say.
- **Testing:** One of the strongest reports of PCR testing yet, over 20K.
Appears the testing numbers are finally increasing.
It's it just me that feels it's kind of convenient for our testing numbers to come back so low right before the last press conference them they sprang up after?
Right now I'm just happy to see testing up.
For sure! It goes from "shit, these numbers are high, but almost believable" to "shit, testing numbers are super low." Both thoughts are followed by "Ducey is a spineless, incompetent moron."
Testing is lacking, deaths are on the rise, new infections confirmed around 3000 a day.
I just reminded someone yesterday, that due due to the backlogged testing/reporting, we're not seeing the impact of 4th of July in the #s yet, except in those so sick they've required hospital assessment and/or treatment.
I think what I am concerned with is if testing truly has dropped, there is a decent chance it is because the lag is so bad.
And we're not seeing a "sharp change in direction." High daily infection rates, increasing daily death toll, insufficient testing, and tests backlogged to hell.
Also we are facing long testing times here - I got tested before planning to see an at risk family member but 10 days later do not have my results, so flying in and getting tested immediately might not be an easy option.
This was prior to the testing mess, so I did get a test prior to going.
In the event it is authorized to send a glass sample for testing this will only be after a delay had already occured.
I've seen 100+ samples come in from a single location with no testing marked which causes at least 1 day of delay.
As far as bigger players, whatever federal surge testing capacity was being shipped out of state probably took a bite out of this.
Embry stated last weekend that they have moved to a new testing company.
The only data we have right now is awful, it’s a heavily biased stream of tests that are sometimes 30% positive because we’re testing people who suspect they’ve been exposed.
and Doug Ducey himself is willing to share slide after slide of misleading coronavirus numbers, knowing full well that our testing was in decline all week, and that results were backlogged for weeks.
The testing backlogs are so bad right now that nobody will be able to tell if they're infected in a timely manner.
My best friend caught coronavirus and was testing positive SIX weeks after the initial positive test.
He’s testing negative now, seven plus weeks along.
Sonora is 1 of 28 testing labs and they have over 58k tests in their queue as of yesterday.
- **Cases:** Testing, case reporting back to previous levels.
- **Testing:** PCR tests went up by 5,400 tests since yesterday, still not out of normal reporting range.
On the bright side the reported tests for July 6th-8th are now approaching numbers from the week before, so it looks like (at least Pima, I haven't done this for the state as a whole) testing didn't drop per se, they're just all in @#$%ing freezers in labs.
2: "I told my people 'SLOOOOOOW the testing down, please.'"
If you keep testing how will it magically disappear?
Did the drive thru testing at CVS on July 9th at 9:00 AM.
I could have eaten something bad, or just not feel very good for whatever reason not related to covid-19 and have to be out of work for 12+ days just because the testing results are so delayed.
The results of the testing being done here are questionable at best.
- **Testing:** PCR tests went up by 2,400-ish tests since yesterday.
We were told that there would be far more PCR testing this week with the addition of the 2 new federal surge testing sites that have come to the valley this past week.
We also were told that one of the labs got an additional testing machine that will be able to process more tests daily.
What I can’t understand is how we’ve consistently seen less tests processed every day for the past week in comparison to before we had all of this additional testing capability come to our state.
“SLOW THE TESTING DOWN”
Hopefully he gets grilled about the severe drop in testing and the backlog during the questions.
Ok so at this point testing in AZ is completely useless.
We’re obviously not reporting all the tests (we were consistently over 15k a day for weeks and suddenly our reported testing is basically cut in half.
Dude what the actual fuck is happening with Arizona's testing.
Georgia testing is screwed up.
(Sorry for those of you who do, you really win for worst testing.).
I'm assuming it must be another lab, but then why are the testing numbers down so much, since supposedly Sonora Quest does the bulk of the testing?
Slow down testing, manipulate the reporting and before you know it just magically disappears.
If one state did pool testing they would instantly have a huge r0 value because they'd detect more cases.
Testing was just too lagged to show the full extent of the problem here in AZ.
The testing is bad but this continues to be a good sign with ER and hospitalization averages going down.
I think the "hopeful" take on this is that SonoraQuest isn't able to process as many tests right now because they're getting their new testing machine set up, at which point we'd see a massive jump in daily test results.
The Rt.live methodology involves attempting to correct for testing volume.
PCR testing indicates 26.7%
The saliva-based testing will be going on throughout the state in the weeks to come, focusing on underprivileged communities.
Wait, I think I [found it]#novel-coronavirus-saliva-testing)! Looks like they are doing testing tomorrow morning from 7-noon at State Farm Stadium.
However, whether it's 21% or 27%, it's way, way too high and due to the low testing level and delayed reporting it's completely out of control and no-one knows what the true picture in AZ is at the moment.
I believe that we honestly don't know how bad (or good) the situation is due to the absolutely terrible testing we have as a state.
But if you don't believe any of the data (hospital data has nothing to do with testing/backlog) then I don't know what to tell you?
I'll wait to draw conclusions on data about last week when the testing backlog is processed and adhs stops updating reports for tests that were performed 2 weeks ago.
Then, ignoring testing completely, there is a downward trend in hospital metrics, which has nothing to do with the backlog of testing numbers.
Look at it under the laboratory testing on the website.
Antibody testing suggests that maybe ~5% of the US population has been exposed and is presumably pretty safe.
Or that attempts at creating a vaccine for the SARS 1'(coronavirus) never got past the animal testing stage because the vaccine either caused severe complications, death, or actually made the wirus worse?
3) I believe they just uncovered that the advertisements for these new testing sites were NOT done in a Spanish version, which of course could have prevented the notice reaching many people in the valley.
They recently set up a couple public testing locations and reportedly they haven't been frequented as much as was anticipated.
Given that testing was harder to come by there in the last months, how would residents there know it’s suddenly available?
I think if places are not filled it is because information in general regarding testing availability is not consistent or clear.
Places will ask if you have a doctor's order, some if you try to make an appointment online will tell you you should see your doctor but not provide testing access.
It has seemed at times that testing shouldn't occur except under the strictest circumstances.
With testing taking WEEKS, parents will absolutely send their kids to school without taking proper quarantine precautions.
He spent four weeks in the ICU at banner desert, and he was still testing positive six WEEKS after he caught the disease.
Demand for testing is low?
I focused on testing is down and incomplete data.
Reminder: we have no idea how we're doing in Arizona because of the testing processing backlog.
How can he quote the average daily cases with a straight face considering the testing nonsense?
"We botched all testing efforts before this past week.
Testing trends are meaningless at the moment.
First thing I heard out of his mouth was how our percent positive is going down, and number of cases, but our testing has turned into an absolute joke.
Ramp up the testing!
This whole testing thing is such a mess.
I hope some reporters challenge his account and force him to confront the severity of what the DATA is showing us about this situation, especially regarding testing.
Setting policy and decisions based on trend data that is known to be clinically useless due to the extreme testing delays.
Why are the testing numbers DROPPING when we have a backlog?
I would love to know the status of Operation Catapult and what is being done to achieve the goal of 35,000 daily tests because in the past week we have only decreased testing by an alarming rate.
Why have reported testing numbers decreased at a time when that data is vital to informed decisions on school openings?
My question is this - since we know that we've had drastically reduced testing, compounded by inaccurate or incomplete data from labs, are we going to make the same mistake again and re-open too early?
I agree with the majority of the above posts that the #1 question has to be on the testing numbers and why they have been so low.
Can you ask him how he can say numbers are down when our testing is currently on a massive downward trend?
Also how can he sit there with a straight face saying cases are on a downward trend when we're doing literally half the testing as compared to this time last week.
Seriously, he keeps bringing up number of cases, which don't matter at all because this fucker has decided to stop testing.
You can waste resources over testing but I don't think any state is at that level especially due to how damage this virus can do to society.
The testing numbers are so low that basically you can't find the cases to stop the virus so the plan is to so broad social mitigations on the entire populace.
You can't know it because there is not enough testing.
Why does he keep pushing for testing at over 300 sites since the lab partners can't keep up.
Seems like percent positive would be a better way to gauge things, especially since our testing is abysmally low.
We aren't as terrible as Maricopa but we sure aren't great, we have had kids under 10 testing positive in the past few days, and that's the age I work with.
Send some of that testing capacity in the direction of Cochise County! My neighbor got turned away when he requested a test just yesterday.
Yeah the two federal testing sites in AZ are allegedly at low capacity and they send the tests out of state for processing.
Like my brain is trying to process, "Sonora Quest is backlogged 60,000 tests" and "We can test 5,000 a day but our testing lot is empty."
Especially with testing delays.
There was also an ABC 15 article on two new surge sites for testing that were mostly empty all day.
Still no state mask mandate, restaurants stayed open longer than bars, restaurants still at 50% capacity, testing capacity still a HUGE problem, etc.
But from outside testing, yeah 2-3+ weeks.
COVID-19 ANTIBODY TESTING is being reported in under 24 hours.
COVID-19 ACTIVE INFECTION TESTING is being reported in under 24 hours for hospital customers while most other testing is reported within 9 days.
Then we could reserve these pcrs for in hospital testing, where the sensitivity actually matters.
She is saying we need more testing yet we can't even keep up.
- **Cases:** Another lackluster day of testing; we have crossed the 150K positive cases mark.
- **Testing:** PCR tests fell 7,800-ish tests since yesterday.
I've all but given up on our state to get testing on track...
What’s even more shitty is that there’s going to be a lot of anti maskers who won’t get tested at all so there will people a huge lack in testing.
The lack of testing is on the verge of being criminal.
There has to be something behind the lack of testing.
Wtf is going on with testing?
Testing never goes up to the number it used to be at (15,000+ per day regularly) even with the supposed additions of the late lab reports.
Should I go get a test even if I don't need one so that we have more testing done.
Hope they don't let it go, and chase after the testing numbers based on today's data.
So the problem isn't that we aren't testing enough, but that they're not processing the tests they are doing fast enough?
They are also only testing symptomatic employees, so who knows how many asymptomatic/presymptomatic employees we have.
"How can any of the testing statistics be trusted when there's an enormous backlog and as of Wednesday, the majority of our new cases were from tests 8-14 days ago?"
What exactly is holding up the testing?
I feel they toot their own horn on all the testing they’re doing while they pat themselves on the back, but doing it AND our current data is completely useless when 62K test are backlogged.
Is there any chance you guys can look at the recent drop in reported PCR testing numbers as well?
This seems like a pretty big testing decrease, and I imagine that could lead to decisions short on very needed information for our state.
Did they confirm that they are storing the samples at -70 degrees before testing?
Just a heads up there are plenty of clinics that are doing testing that have a 3-5 day turnaround time since they are not affiliated with Sonora Quest!!
Are they short of testing supplies like reagents?
Who makes the tests?
There are 2,000 free tests available at 510 W Tidwell today in Houston.
By the end of the week, he says the state will be able to administer up to 20,000  COVID-19 tests per week.
Abbott said “we have too many tests available” **two weeks ago.** We need massive testing drives just to get a grasp on how bad this really is, but I guarantee you as symptoms start rolling out it’ll be too late and we’ll begin overwhelming the hospitals.
and yet 3 days ago (Monday 3/16) we only had capacity to conduct ~1900 tests per week.
I assume they ran some tests after they accidentally released the one person too soon.
I'm not suggesting that zero tests have been done, just such an extremely tiny number it is nearly impossible to know if there is any community transmission.
Up until Monday the national had only run ~500 tests per the CDC.
But I could be wrong and missed that San Antonio had run several hundred tests in the past 3 days.
We turned down getting tests a few months ago.
Now we're trying to catch up to demand and it's gonna take awhile to get enough tests to make that happen.
There's confusion on the number of tests, number of cases, and more.
Testing matters and will continue too wether we have enough tests or not.
Right now, my employer’s plan changes by the hour as the number of positive tests grow.
Abbot just said only 200 tests have been reported, more will be reported later.
It has around 30% positive tests, If they tested around 29 a day in Houston since around 3/5 or 3/6, seems like it’s about 10-20% accuracy rate.
First: due to pathetic testing capacity at Texas public health labs, Texas can only test 279 samples per day, despite the Feds having sent them tests for hundreds of thousands.
In addition, some state health labs have developed their own tests and are using them (New York, Massachusetts).
Second: Many research medical schools and hospitals have developed their own tests and are using them.
The University of Washington -Medicine, for example, has a lab capable of 4,000 tests per day.
But down in the Texas Medical Center, it's all hat and no cattle--they don't seem to have the ability to develop their own tests.
They wanted to test me for flu/strep first because they said they didn't have a lot of corona tests.
I know alot of people arr upset about there not being any tests available.
I know testing is limited but they shouldn’t disguise the issue and work on getting more tests.
Happening in every state too, no one can gets tests in america.
2019, and instead chose to research and develop their own tests through private companies.
It's up to local governments....ours just announced yesterday that there won't be any drive thru tests because we don't need it (there are no confirmed cases at the moment)...okay cool, but are we going to wait until we are in full disaster mode before getting those set up?
I’m just not sure if the people failing to ensure we get access to tests are the ones we want running the whole healthcare show for Texas.
There aren’t enough tests and we just don’t know.
Yes the issues with these tests was ironed out a week an half ago supppsedly..
WHERE ARE THE TESTS??
How many tests have been completed, And how many positives.
Colorado is probably responding the best(they account for 10% of the nations tests last time I checked) and they can lean both ways.
Some tests were coming back as positive when they weren't, and some negative when they should have been positive.
There are no tests coming to the public at large.
Only enough tests for medical professionals at this time.
Is up to 2k tests per day and is being transparent About both positives AND negatives.
TLDR, at that point Oklahoma had a capacity of 100 tests per day, for the entire state.
We’re getting more tests very soon.
Our numbers are low because we just didn’t have that many tests at first.
I literally know which boxes tests/samples/medicines ship in and it's a miniscule percentage of what we move.
As of yesterday, only 1200 tests were performed across the state and we have one of the largest populations.
You can read so many stories (including mine) of people wanting tests with Pneumonia like symptoms turned away from the county health departments.
You think they are wasting tests on every respiratory death?
When the number of tests increases we are going to see a huge jump in the number of cases and deaths.
Only 439 tests have been given in 6 weeks.
Call your local reps, congressmen, senators and governors and ask them, “Where are the tests?” Hammer home that there have only been 500 tests given and that is unacceptable.
As of yesterday 3/17/20, only 1200 tests were performed across the state and we have one of the largest populations.
It is insane; we need tests.
As more tests are available here in Texas, we are going to see a huge increase in positive tests.
"For COVID-19 tests per capita, Texas ranks dead last, 48th in total public health emergency preparedness, and 41st in public healtcare spending per capita."
they have kits but even the new roche kits require reagents they don't have much of at the actual labs that process the tests.
Thus there are still tight requirements to get the tests.
Only 439 tests in 6 weeks.
Every day I call all my reps; congressmen, senators, and governor to ask them where are the tests while telling them that 439 tests in 6 weeks is unacceptable.
[CDC Bureaucratic Bungling of Covid-19 Tests.].
Tests.** Only 439 tests have been administered in 6 weeks, that is unacceptable.
The tests, right now, basically track viral exposure for data purposes at the moment.
Tests are needed to understand the true depth and breadth of Coronavirus infections and to provide data on whether containment measures are working.
We should be cranking out 10k+ tests per day.
Shit, so 15% of all tests state wide tested positive in Dallas alone.
Regardless of whether tests are available, I'd call DSHS and tell them about this.
They may have more tests and willing to get you one.
All my strep tests were negative.
Abbot just said they can do 150 tests today.
Rapid Strep tests are known for false negatives.
Even midland closed their schools, and there’s no cases/tests there either! Like take your head out of your ass for literally two seconds and think about the big picture here.
On that last tidbit, it is why serial testing (multiple tests over a span of days) is needed to catch the virus while it is shedding.
“At this time, the limited number of tests available are controlled by the state and local health departments and are being reserved for more seriously ill patients, those with known exposure to confirmed patients, and those with recent travel (within 14 days) to countries with high rates of COVID-19 (Coronavirus).”
“No tests.
I see what you’re saying about the tests and I agree that testing will only help so much at this point.
Thanks for speaking up on this, the administration falsely assumes that in making the tests almost impossible to get, then “Trump kept it at bay and protected the people of Texassshh.”
I wish we had more tests...
There are not enough tests to have our numbers rising as high as they likely are.
Tests are limited.
But we've been told every week that "millions of tests nationwide are available next week".
“There are a limited number of tests...but we shouldn’t just accept that fact.” Um ok?
I’m not excusing the lack of tests, I’m just saying they are being reserved for those that need it at this point in time.
More than 200 Texans have been tested for Covid-19 by CDC or other health labs, with 300 more tests slated.
Were gonna go from what...20 tests a day to 1400 a day?
Haven't tests been coming "next week" nationwide for about three weeks now?
They obviously dont have enough tests and resources to test anyone that doesnt have any direct link to china.
Treated for bronchitis, 'We have no tests', that's what they said.
I was told " we have limited tests".
Still what was the point of telling me that there were limited tests, like they wanted to guilt me out of not testing or something?
If they are telling you try Jefferson County, they have no tests here.
Bet his tune will change once HE tests positive!
Is this like the old taks tests?
can i get a free five on the ap tests tho.
As a former student who had to endure all of the high school STAAR tests, I second this.
They were called TAAS tests back in my day.
ive never studied for any staar tests and still passed all of em.
Most worthless tests ever.
My kids teachers have them spend a good portion of the school year learning how to take the STAAR test and doing practice tests.
Yup I remember those, getting ready to graduate college and still have no idea what the point of those tests were.
Talk about limiting tests in Texas to the elite.
And in the border region of south Texas people are begging for tests and not getting any.
We have no tests.
Yeah, because you can’t confirm without tests, dumbass.
Just have to wait for us to get tests.
I'm pretty sure our numbers are low because of a lack of tests and transparency.
There is a doctor in Edinburg that has tests and is currently testing people.
Tests which take 1-3 days to process or more if processing is backlogged, for something that takes on average 6 days but up to 14 before detectable and symptomatic....
You’ll probably need a doctors order prior to any of these drive thru tests.
Our PCP didn't know anything about how to do tests and it was only after a maze of phone calls we found that the BSW ERs were doing testing.
I was surprised they didn't make her do a panel of flu & strep tests like older stories but maybe tests are ramping up so they don't have to conserve as much?
All coverage , tests and treatment are covered.
Looks like we are rationing tests more aggressively than we should still.
We still don’t have enough tests do to this like Asia.
Mainly bc our country chose to partner with our private sector instead of getting tests from Europe and Asia (who have easily accessible tests readily available).
They met my baby before getting sick, now she’s sick and the pediatrician today said he they don’t have tests.
First off, we don’t even have tests available.
Secondly, $200 out of pocket tests?
In order to qualify for this drive thru you have to have multiple tests done like strep and flu (out of pocket if you don’t have insurance or a co pay).
Still not accessible for majority of people who need tests.
It says the tests were positive, self-reported means the people came forward with their symptoms to seek a test.
Community Care IS dealing with private labs, but no test kits to do tests with.
Good man, thanks for posting this and I hope the people that need tests the most get them!
The health district said other tests have been performed privately and it does not track those."
Maybe because counties have been saying that there are 0 cases when there actually have been 0 tests?
Health district should require all private tests in the county be reported to them so they can track the virus.
Only one Houston, Texas area county will release number of COVID-19 tests performed, “Other counties say releasing the numbers could create an "alarmed public reaction."
Only thing I’m confused on is there have been tests where the test came back negative twice and then positive a third time (the two separate couples coming off the Diamond Princess cruise).
Any idea what your being billed for the other tests?
I would definitely *want* one if another week goes by and I am still sick or getting worse, but with the lack of tests, I feel lucky I even got the first one and I feel like they would reject me immediately.
Not sure if it’s all the tests or just the one.
White House press conference this morning reiterated that the uninsured will not pay for tests or treatment.
It might have been Wuhan tests.
We desperately need more tests.
I've heard that some tests are faulty.
There are so few tests and so many that need them, so I’m going to wait/self quarantine.
Even our doc in the box does flu tests.
You presented to an Emergency Room with mild symptoms, they assessed you, took a history, and ran a pretty substantial amount of tests regardless to the fact your symptoms are mild.
There aren't enough tests yet to test most outpatients.
Will students still have to take the STAAR tests?
Why aren’t drs just swabbing and sending for tests?
We have a severe lack of tests.
The state of New York has more than double the number confirmed positive tests than Texas has of any kind of test, positive or negative.
18 and March 12, there were 13,624 tests for COVID-19 conducted in the U.S.
Meanwhile, South Korea has conducted over 100,000 tests, and the U.K.
There are numerous places in Texas and shared within this thread offering tests for $200.
3 positive cases out of 20 tests done.
“In total, 20 and 25 tests have been done at the Tyler lab.”
Absolutely insane they said the statewide capacity was 273 tests a day, yet they've only tested a total of 220 people with 75 tests currently in process (so 295 total tests administered).
On the other hand there are plenty of people in the Austin area with documented exposure to confirmed positive cases who aren't feeling well and have been denied tests.
so it's not super surprising that there's no other positive tests from the campus.
It's important to remember they are making a travel history or a known exposure to a confirmed diagnosis prerequisites for tests, so they are literally not testing anyone who could confirm community spread is happening.
There is a shortage of the chemicals that are required to run the tests.
Not create the swabs but run the tests.
I just started looking into this about 8 days ago when I noticed the promises on tests were not being fulfilled.
So even though test kits are deployed, the private sector cant keep up with demand because there's not enough reagents to process the CDC PCR tests.
Tons of stories of people who might be infected with symptoms not getting tested due to lack of tests.
I’m not leaving the house until widespread tests are done.
If POTUS catches it - that will wake people up! I wonder if the Secret Service agents getting a crash course on administering tests prior to having president meet anyone.
Hey guys! Just an update on this — they only have a few tests left PLEASE don’t go unless you think you have it and have symptoms.
These tests are VERY limited (thx Trump) so please let the people who need it get them!
In my opinion, as long as we have a shortage of tests available, we should be specifically testing patients who do NOT have a history of travel or exposure in order to find new clusters of community spread.
There aren't enough tests, and unfortunately we can't test everyone we want to.
Tests are going to those who've travelled, or the very ill hospitalized patient.
So botched that it's almost like CDC intentionally held back tests, primarily via overly rigid clinical criteria, to ~~avoid~~ delay panic.
Obviously we'll probably start seeing grade school closures in infected communities by next week if the containment procedures keep on being this lackluster or tests become more available.
A lot of people in Austin don’t seemed concerned because there are no positive tests, but we are not testing.
I really hope an employee tests positive! (Not that I hope anyone has it, I’m just sure that people already do have it!) Then maybe aisd will take it seriously like the rest of the state is doing.
* Harris County has had to wait for state approval before tests could be sent to the city lab or to the Atlanta CDC lab
Exactly how many tests can Texas perform in a day?
However, Texas is not administering tests to patients unless they; have a travel history linked to outbreak countries and/or are hospitalized.
It’s important to test anyone that looks as if they could have it, but the tests are reserved for the very ill who have tested negative for influenza A and B.
We don’t have enough tests.
We are doing the best we can while we deal with this BS situation of having no tests.
Currently we can only do 25ish tests for all of central Texas.
What and who needs to do something to get more tests?
Hope they arent planning on doing PCR tests or its gonna be a fizzle.
I get that they are trying to prioritize the tests.
Other places have also developed tests.
Basically the administration wanted to slow play the testing but now that quick read tests are available I have to imagine we will go to that instead of the 3 day tests that the state is currently using.
Normally the CDC would just provide the tests themselves but their test was crap.
I agree with you, but until more tests are available there isn’t much the doctors can do.
I'm pretty disappointed with our state's lack of ingenuity when it comes to these tests.
My grandpa (the mayor) said they’re also low on supplies for tests.
Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp both have tests available nationwide (just verified on their websites).
I’m a ER doctor and  anytime I want to test anyone that doesn’t have a specific known contact of COVID19 or isn’t from Italy, China, Iran, or Korea I got told an emphatic “No” from the health department because they barely have 100 tests per day for the entire state of Texas.
Nothing major but I had 4 tests this week and no real options but to take them.
Tests are so limited, he's probably not going to be eligible.
Link: [Brazilian official who met Trump at Mar-a-Lago tests positive for coronavirus].
I’m afraid we’ll soon see our numbers reported just under China’s when tests are available and without restrictions.
City of Austin's official response to why they're not reporting negative cases or how many tests are complete.
It would completely explain mystery of the - what seems like - intentional slow-boating of the tests.
not enough tests, not enough masks.
We COULD be using tests from other countries but we are just assholes about stuff that matters.
It's standard to rush to produce tests when a new disease is on the horizon - but it USED to be standard to defer to whoever won the race and just go with it.
Instead, we forged ahead and released faulty tests at the start rather than use someone else's.
Too many hypochondriacs without the right symptoms showing up demanding tests.
You think the other countries want to share tests with us when we have nothing to share with them?
Egypt and china traded tests and facemasks.
There is sufficient testing capacity now for anyone with flu-like symptoms who tests negative for the flu to be tested for Covid-19.
This subreddit has posts from Doctors working in ERs that have seen patients with all the symptom that are requesting tests and still not receiving them.
Presumptive positive could mean failed tests for the flu (negative) without a positive cov test.
Usually two tests per patient for confirmation, sometimes more for individuals already in quarantine.
“They told me nope, there are no tests, don’t come in, don’t do anything”.
Some of these concerns above, the unknowns of the virus transmission and rate itself, plus lacks of accurate supplies/tests and hoops and hurdles criteria for testing, has slowed the release—stunted the accurate picture of this virus.
For instance, opening testing to private labs will probably blossom numbers going forward as capacity to test was greatly increased, and doctors can now submit tests outside the traveler/contact with known case criteria.
Think it’s because it’s the county that tests not the city.
I guess the CDC used 2-week ground shipping for those tests they sent out.
I just read San Antonio only has 75 tests available so probably not testing.
Not enough tests to go around b/c of stuff you can google or read on this sub.
And then they deny tests except for the very ill!
Having labs that can process tests, is not the same thing as having test kits.
Okay but have they even run any tests?
Do you have enough tests?
How many Coronavirus tests are being done each day?
Therefore tests are not being done in hospitals (atleast not at my facility) and people are being quarantined to stop the spreading.
As for how many tests we have in San Antonio, our facility is not told the number of tests in our city, rather we are told the samples taken for needed tests are sent out to a designated testing location.
Thank you! Like I mentioned, I knew the testing was limited, but I did not know the exact number of locations/amount of tests.
In my gut, I know our numbers are way higher than being reported and I think this week and next, will be a huge shock when tests kits come back.
The tests had about a 3 day return time.
Tests rationed.
Our tests just haven't caught up with the number of cases there actually are.
Her primary care doctor didn't know wtf covid was or how to get the tests, so they called her back and said to go to an emergency room but to call first to see if they can do the test.
Then you look at US, dots are smaller than other countries because the total numbers are spread by states, and they don’t seem to grow much because of manipulation of tests kits that forces the totals to artificially low numbers.
Even Coronavirus deaths are not appearing in the US map as long as the patient was rejected a test and hence considered non-corona related (although per doctors’ testimony they had all symptoms and tests like CT proved it).
I know for a fact that if you're an Aetna member, copay and deductible are waived entirely for any COVID19 tests administered that meet the guidelines (symptoms) set by the CDC.
Hopefully doctors will start ordering tests.
Harris County says that they will only provide information pertaining to confirmed tests.
I’m reading that in Washington, some of these old folks are dying of “unspecified pneumonia” because there aren’t enough tests.
They will only tell us when someone tests positive, and I am not confident they will tell us right away.
Yes, it could be untrue, but I read that in that care facility in Washington old folks are dying from “unspecified pneumonia” because there are no tests.
We are being rationed tests.
My theory - not based upon media reports, but actually reading CDC pandemic plans and watching what is continuing to happen with the tests - is that there was a determination, early on, that this could not and would not be contained.
So, you believe that 59 - 79 negative tests and 1 positive test have been conducted there?
When asked if how many people have been tested, their response is, "we aren't going to spread fear, and we will only report positive tests."
Many states, including some of the country’s most populous, are not reporting how many tests they have conducted overall.
Never said if they actually sent tests off and was just deemed negative by the hospital?
Reports coming in of entire states getting less than 2k tests.
I was under the impression the tests are coming down from the federal level and have been minimally available.
"When all the labs receive the validation necessary to test for the virus, the state will be able to process more than 125 COVID-19 tests a day, Abbott said.
So even if that is true, who will process the tests?
They stated it would drop back to Phase 1 if the tests were negative.
Tests for flu and strep were negative.
Tests were sent but I don’t know the results (trust me I’ve been checking).
The tests pending message was 6 days ago.
New tests created now should take 24-72 hours.
From what I hear they are denying people tests and only testing if you’ve traveled to China/Italy or have been in direct contact with someone who is positive.
I’ve heard that and also that they aren’t releasing tests that come back negative, just positive.
Today: 7,375 cases, 366 deaths, only 622 recovered (although this virus is reportedly cyclical, there is a silent period and then it comes back again much worse than the previous time, after neg tests)
There are not enough tests right now so that’s why no other cases have been reported.
I heard they don’t have enough tests but I wonder if it isn’t willful ignorance.
The bacterial cultures/tests were negative.
Its likely here the only positive tests we know are of people who got to or were already in a medical facility.
tests are good but they arent helping if you arent quarantining or stoping public gatherings.
If tests are scarce, expand use of X-ray to evaluate for any sign of pneumonia.
this is going to just force people to NOT get tested, because not only are they worried about having to pay for the tests with shitty or no health care, they'll have to worry about criminal penalties if they need to go to get food or medicine for family members likely also under quarantine.
According to a recent news story, they “monitor” and tell people to self-isolate if they have symptoms, but no reports of any tests run.
Tests have definitely been run on patients here.
Governor recently reported they are “ramping up” to be able to run 10 tests a day in Dallas next week (and 10-25 a day in other cities).
That’s not much in a metro area this size, and local officials have to be willing to actually use the tests.
Just after I posted that I realized your post stated there had in fact been tests haha I should learn to reading comprehension.
I feel like we should be testing everyone with flu like symptoms for flu, followed by COVID19 if flu tests negative, and we should definitely be testing everyone with pneumonia.
labs have enough testing kits--which supposedly will be in the next couple of days, unless the FDA is lying again--the bottleneck will be the number of labs/personnel that can do the tests.
The current estimate is a max of 15,000 tests per day in the U.S.
Remember, there's a time delay between exposure and confirmed tests, often with unknown locations where it may have been contracted.
on top of that the US based tests have horrible accuracy, some people testing false twice before finally getting a positive.
Tests have given inconsistent results.
I would feel better knowing tests are being done and coming back negative.
We cannot rely on the Gov't for reliable tests or info, I was hoping we could rely on our states and cities.
Announcing negative tests would do more to slow panic than zero information, would it not?
They don’t want to let anyone know how few tests they’re actually doing.
That's because they don't want us to know how few tests are actually being done.
I guess there been no announcement bc of the problem with both false positives and false negatives, so they run multiple tests on single patients and get conflicting results.
So we will never know how many actually have it due to the limited number of tests available and the restrictions they are putting on tests.
I agree, panic could cause big problems, but right now the biggest problem hospitals are facing is a shortage of tests and supplies.
Hospitals, in Texas at least, already have the tests and supplies.
Tests are being done.
Not sure where these tests were sent from, so you'd probably have to call around and ask to make sure you don't get charged.
Also my understanding is that tests are taking 3-5 days to show results right now.
Looks like houston dept of health is doing **tests.**
They have a testing station in Austin (one) at a lab, but none of the hospitals have tests, according to them.
They’re confirming it by CDC again, but one of the tests already said positive so he most likely has it.
The lab has only tests 1 or two cases...for all of Texas?
I don't have AZ influenza death data at hand, but let's use the season the COVID hoaxers like to use (2017-18) at the CDC estimated 80,000.
Covid with influenza.
[hospitalizations are down] click on "Hospital COVID-like & Influenza-like Illness Surveillance" and "Hospital Bed Usage & Availability".
that [hospitalizations are down] assuages me (click Hospital COVID-like & Influenza-like Illness Surveillance).
Ignore the fact that the CDC itself removed 55,000 deaths that were pneumonia and influenza yet the victim carried COVAID19.
Imagine if we tried that approach with Influenza?
And then how will those 1 in 5 people's immune system respond when they face influenza or other common illness.
without vaccine, did we ever reach "herd immunity" with anything like influenza, measles, polio, smallpox?
* Downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) reported within a 14-day period.
At any given time, there are dozens if not hundreds of *major* influenza strains around the globe (probably on the order of thousands including minor strains).
Influenza viruses are several orders of magnitude more complex than covid, so those predictions are roughly equatable to guessing the outcome of a roll of a 100-sided die (the covid vaccine would be more like predicting the outcome of a 1-sided die, *maybe* a 2-sided die by next year).
Those are how type A influenzas are classified.
Influenza viruses can have any H type and any A type (but not all are found in humans), leading to hundreds of different pairings for just the umbrella categories.
They can only mutate very slowly in a process known as genetic drift (which influenza can also do).
Any who, 2-3 influenza A strains are typically included in the vaccine each year, along with an influenza B strain, and then - cross your fingers!
Thank you for taking the time and effort to explain the influenza and covid vaccines in an understandable manner! We appreciate your input.
According to [this broad and comprehensive study] yesterday, face_masks can reduce the risk of transmission over ***6-fold.***  That's even more effective than getting an annual flu vaccine has on reducing the risk of influenza.
I did not include influenza data.
By contrast, according to the CDC, counted deaths during the peak week of the influenza seasons from 2013-2014 to 2019-2020 ranged from 351 (2015-2016, week 11 of 2016) to 1626 (2017-2018, week 3 of 2018).
The mean number of counted deaths during the peak week of influenza seasons from 2013-2020 was 752.4 (95% CI, 558.8-946.1).These statistics on counted deaths suggest that the number of COVID-19 deaths for the week ending April 21 was 9.5-fold to 44.1-fold greater than the peak week of counted influenza deaths during the past influenza seasons in the US, with a 20.5-fold mean increase (95% CI, 16.3-27.7).5,6.
For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.
As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.
The ratios we present are more clinically consistent with frontline conditions than ratios that compare COVID-19 fatality counts and estimated seasonal influenza deaths.
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.
From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.

Downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) reported within a 14-day period.
1, 1,013 other individuals in Arizona died from pneumonia with no recorded link to either COVID-19 or influenza.  
That makes more noninfluenza pneumonia deaths in Arizona in just three months than each full year of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (official data is not yet available for 2019). 
In 2018, Arizona recorded 903 pneumonia deaths unrelated to the flu; from 2014 to 2017, noninfluenza pneumonia deaths were in the 700s, per U.S.
Deaths involving certain conditions such as influenza and  pneumonia are more likely to require manual coding than other causes of  death.
Other respiratory illnesses, such as influenza, typically worsen in the winter and dissipate in the summer.
But while common influenza follows a seasonal pattern, pandemic influenzas have not.
She noted that pandemic influenza patterns don’t follow the same seasonal patterns.

(3) there were significantly higher influenza vacination rates this season, especially compared to the bad 2017-2018 season (about 60% more vaccinations given) [slide 9].
Instead, he said, it's more likely that the new coronavirus will establish itself as a seasonal virus like influenza that requires attention year to year.
For a few months now, Kinsa has worked with [Benjamin Dalziel,] a disease modeler at Oregon State University who uses electronic medical records, C.D.C.’s influenza surveillance network and other data to map the way the flu season historically rises and falls across the country.

I've focused mostly on ILI (influenza-like-illness) surveillance data.
After ruling out influenza with a rapid test in the office, along with strep, I obtained a swab for Covid 19.
This shows the reporting of influenza like illness within the state of Arizona from all urgent care providers that are reporting to the health dept.
It appears that Maricopa County is still only testing people with confirmed contact with someone previously diagnosed with COVID-19, people with recent travel history AND requiring hospitalization, and people requiring hospitalization with a negative influenza test and respiratory viral panel.

[Risk of stroke 8 times higher with COVID than influenza] Also hospitals LOSE money while caring for COVID patients which is why many are on the verge of bankruptcy.[The coronavirus is devastating U.S.
We know that people are dying of non-influenza pneumonia and are not being counted.
Unlike influenza, there are several documented long-term health impacts, such as irreversible lung damage, neurological issues resulting in cognitive impairment and loss of senses, strokes caused by blood clots in patients in their 30s and 40s, and liver damage.
Same! I had “influenza type A” but it was worse and had issues with bronchitis and my heart rate was high and kept having chest pains but they said they couldn’t figure out why.
In an adjusted analysis of compliant subjects, masks as a group had protective efficacy in excess of 80% against clinical influenza-like illness.

\#8 Influenza AND Pneumonia:  55,672.
Which led to the following conclusion: Covid-19 “transmission in children in schools appears considerably less than seen for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza.”"
Likely it’s because they’ve gotten sick in the past with what they thought was influenza but was actually a stomach virus.
Last winter, influenza and its complications killed more than 80,000 in the United States and hospitalized more than 900,000 — the highest totals for death and illness during a seasonal outbreak since CDC numbers on flu deaths were first reported in 1976.
Another research article "Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face_masks" Abstract: We identified seasonal human coronaviruses, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses in exhaled breath and coughs of children and adults with acute respiratory illness.
Surgical face_masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets.
Our results indicate that surgical face_masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals.
There is no reason for a 34% rise in pneumonia and influenza, especially during statewide lockdowns and social distancing protocol.
I cannot replicate his data looking at influenza reports.
Nationally, levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and COVID-19-like illness (CLI) activity remain lower than peaks seen in March and April but are increasing in most regions.
Of the leading causes of death in the US the only one that is a communicable disease like Covid is influenza.
What I do to protect myself and others from influenza is get a flu shot every year.

Too bad it isn't seasonal like influenza.
According to the CDC: “Deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia or influenza deaths in the absence of positive test results, and pneumonia or influenza may appear on death certificates as a comorbid condition.
Additionally, COVID-19 symptoms can be similar to influenza-like illness, thus deaths may be misclassified as influenza.
Thus, increases in pneumonia and influenza deaths may be an indicator of excess COVID-19-related mortality.”
The conditions in our factory farms make it inevitable that we'll have new influenza and/or coronavirus pandemics in the future.
There was a man in my area who was tested postmortem, and he tested positive for covid19, influenza, and strep.
Meanwhile, Influenza and pneumonia deaths have shot up...
Experts say we're still overdue for an influenza.
N95_masks showed no statistically significant difference in how well they protected against airborne infectious droplets (influenza was the infection of interest, but the mechanism of spreading is the same as COVID-19: airborne droplets).
The CDC reports 6643 deaths by pneumonia from all sources including covid19 but not influenza.
Number of pneumonia+covid19 deaths is 975, total number of influenza deaths is 341.
They have a column in their provisional chart that specifically lists pneumonia deaths with or without COVID-19 and that exclude influenza.
Have you really thought through what will happen to the economy if we just let a new virus with 10x the case fatality rate of influenza spread unchecked?
However also possible you are truly negative and you had a bad influenza flu in March.
Political motivations of a major election year, with more at stake than usual, arguably ever, ended up combining with that ignorance - similar to how the influenza season will combine with active coronavirus outbreaks in autumn.
There's a WHO influenza study that people like to throw around to say masks don't work.

[Even influenza doesn't mutate as fast as the same strain being infectious within the same year, generally.].
Looking at the number of deaths attributed to pneumonia or influenza this year, it makes one wonder.
Last year, there were roughly 10,000 Texans whose cause of death was listed as pneumonia or influenza in total.
[Texas Influenza Report 10/4/2019] At this point last year, there were 1,865 pneumonia and influenza deaths.
[Texas Influenza Report 6/21/2019] All of which makes sense because the an upturn in cases in the fall makes sense.
This year, however, there have already been over 8,000 deaths in Texas alone that have been categorized as pneumonia and influenza.
[Texas Influenza Report 6/15/2020] Similarly, I also believe that hospitals aren't required to report all their influenza numbers but I could be wrong.
DHS is reporting a huge spike in Influenza and Pneumonia cases that aren't linked to Covid, so I agree deaths are being under counted.
The Texas Influenza report of 06/21/2019 deaths is for deaths from 09/30/18 to 01/02/19.
The Texas Influenza Report for 07/26/19 has data for 09/30/18-07/24/19.
They are, I found an article on the DHS site not long ago (trying to find it) with I&P  (Influenza and Pneumonia) Deaths.
Good idea [Texas Influenza Report 6/24/2018]
[Texas Influenza Report 10/08/2018].
Surgical masks reduced the amount of virus released from a sick person in the form of droplets but not aerosols for influenza; the masks reduced coronavirus in both droplets and aerosols; and they didn't reduce either in rhinovirus.
Surgical masks reduced the amount of virus released from a sick person in the form of droplets but not aerosols for influenza; **the masks reduced coronavirus in both droplets and aerosols**; and they didn't reduce either in rhinovirus.
Or claiming that I don't know how to separate influenza and pneumonia stuff.
Texas is Top 5 for Deaths involving Pneumonia, with or without COVID-19, excluding Influenza deaths (cdc - 5694 deaths).
But somehow Texas is 13th for Deaths involving COVID-19 and Pneumonia, excluding Influenza (cdc - 715 deaths).
I calculated only the pneumonia and not the influenza numbers.
* I'm guessing the 2020 figure comes from [here] and subtracting the number for "all deaths involving COVID-19" from the number for "Deaths involving Pneumonia, with or without COVID-19, excluding Influenza deaths".
Just finished reading The Great Influenza by John Barry, and history repeats itself.
How often does influenza cause kawasaki disease, strokes, or severe neurological disorders?
I will have to find it when I get back to my computer the full breakdown of influenza and pneumonia.
There will be a double whammy in fall as we get Corona with a side of influenza.
And then the people who have been pretending that prisons and nursing homes don't count will pretend that every new case is influenza.
Well where you’re finding your biggest obstacle is that you have used numbers in both your posts that are influenza AND pneumonia mortality rates.
No influenza.
100k people did not die in the USA from influenza last year.
I saw a post at wattsupwiththat showing influenza is down 90%+ around the world as people are taking precautions, all while COVID is up all over the world.
The one that shows us at 97% also lists out pneumonia, influenza and COVID+ deaths.
Well, according to your source, you are looking at pneumonia and influenza, while your interlocutor is looking at deaths from all causes, that is significant.
Influenza and Pneumonia killed 2,954 people in Texas in 2017 according to  and 4,620 Pneumonia deaths so far this year (number does not include Covid-19 deaths) according to  while reporting 1,367 due to Covid-19 or Pneumonia and Covid-19 (Week ending 2/1/2020 to 5/16/2020).
In contrast, 351 to 1,626 people died, respectively, during the peak weeks of the influenza seasons from 2013-2014 to 2019-2020.
Influenza typically tapers to an end in March.
We have a well-established influenza monitoring system across the country, and what it's been telling us this year is that the influenza season was not particularly severe.
During a typical influenza season not everyone actually gets a test to confirm it, so influenza numbers are often inferred from other indicators.
2) IT'S NOT EVEN A STRAIN OF INFLUENZA.
And it's not even correct because this isn't an influenza strain.
Also, it’s an ‘IUI’ (influenza like illness), so while not technically influenza, the name arises from its medical categorization.
It's not even influenza.
Truth is, if there's no immunity, we just witnessed the rise of a new common disease similar to rhinovirus and influenza, and there's basically nothing we can do about it.
I love how every time the SARS death toll surpasses the Influenza death toll,  the Influenza death toll somehow gets revised higher in the heads of all the Fox News viewers.
I love how every time the SARS death toll surpasses the Influenza death toll, the Influenza death toll somehow gets revised higher in the heads of all the Fox News viewers.
But, you can get sick from the influenza virus again a year or two after getting the ‘normal flu’.
The study authors explained that research from previous coronavirus and influenza epidemics suggest that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, and the development of, or exacerbation of, heart failure.
You continue to operate under the scare tactic disinfo and you're ignoring is the simple fact:  This bug is no more dangerous, no more widespread than our annual influenza hit.
This bug is no more dangerous, no more widespread than our annual influenza hit.
As of April 27th ([based on the CDC's COVID-19 provisional death count information] 3,497 pneumonia deaths and 310 influenza deaths have occurred in Texas between 2/1 and 4/25.
In Texas, we usually get around 3,000 deaths **per year** from pneumonia and a couple hundred for influenza ([based on Texas Dept of State Health figures from 2011-2015] Take from that what you will.
for RSV and influenza, they don’t do the tests unless they think there is a chance the results will be positive.
The world weathers influenza annually with higher death rates than C19 but the sheople behave as they're told.
There is an influenza flu vaccine and people that get it still die.
My mother-in-law died of pneumonia caused by Influenza A in early April.
In total [in the U.S.], estimated non-flu ILI [influenza-like-illness] from March 8th to 28th exceeded a historical baseline by 23m cases—200 times the number of positive covid-19 tests in that period.
“The percent of deaths associated with pneumonia and influenza is above the epidemic threshold.
The increase is due to an increase in pneumonia deaths rather than influenza deaths and likely reflects COVID-19 activity.”
As of April 10th ([based on the CDC's COVID-19 provisional death count information] 2,481 pneumonia deaths and 277 influenza deaths have occurred in Texas between 2/1 and 4/4.
In Texas, we usually get around 3,000 deaths **per year** from pneumonia and around that much (a couple hundred) for influenza ([based on Texas Dept of State Health figures from 2011-2015]

This guy is using the deaths from influenza which includes things like congestive heart failure and sepsis, whereas the other commenter was making a direct comparison of pneumonia deaths to COVID-19 deaths.
Except you're comparing deaths from COVID-19 to *influenza* meaning any symptom or complication from influenza from pneumonia to congestive heart failure to sepsis, whereas the other commenter is making the more direct comparison of pneumonia deaths to COVID-19.
Both your influenza data and their pneumonia data come from DSHS.
The doctor said it is also possible that, before public health officials detected community spread within the US, many people who died of the coronavirus disease were diagnosed simply with influenza-like illnesses or pneumonia.
So the CDC put out numbers for Texas for Influenza and Pneumonia deaths:
Deaths from Pneumonia and Influenza in Texas.
They don't separate out Pneumonia and Influenza though.
Is there a way to find out how many Influenza deaths there are?
Some influenza like illness deaths since December were attributed to other things, etc.
According to  The influenza season lasts from Sept.
"One thousand eight hundred and sixty-five P&I (pneumonia & influenza) deaths have been reported in Texas during the 2018-2019 influenza season.
Recently saw a report showing where increase in ILI (influenza like illnesses) that were not reported as covid-19 but I can’t refund it.
[CDC Influenza Weekly Reporting].
According to CDC data at   the entirety of 2018 saw 3,516 pneumonia/influenza deaths in Texas.
There are no vaccines for parainfluenza.
HPIV is a group of "parainfluenza" viruses.
It’s fairly well accepted that exposure to Paramyxovirinae antigens in the vaccine are enough to effectively provoke a sufficient immune response in most adults, which partially contributed to the considerably smaller data profile for parainfluenzas.
I had no idea that parainfluenza and mumps were in the same family, much less the same genus.
Her test showed she had influenza A, H1N1.
Laboratory confirmed influenza-associated hospitalization rates for the U.S.
Can someone educate me on why influenza is not taken as seriously as this Coronavirus?
Influenza has simply become a part of human life since it first appeared hundreds if not thousands of years ago.
It's not that we haven't taken influenza seriously in the past, it's that taking all of healthcare seriously right now means doing things differently.
However, were hospitals not overwhelmed by the 400,000 hospitalizations due to influenza last year?
Look up influenza’s history.
Even if natural herd immunity is established, work on a vaccine MUST continue and will likely have to be an **annual event** (or even more frequent – part of that depends on how seasonally affected this virus is and we’re not sure yet, and part of it depends on whether it does mutate to become more – or less – communicable) and **not voluntary** like the Influenza vaccine (I'm no fan of that but that's what it looks like).
Google "texas influenza surveillance report dshs" for the link.
Chinese gov't coverups include the 2003 SARS epidemic even as it traveled to 30 other nations, denying the spread of the dangerous H5N1 "bird flu" influenza in the country for years, and stifling social media accounts of outbreaks; and we all know about their current coverup attempts and spreading lies about coronavirus.
The hospital refused to prescribe an antibiotic because they said I had an unknown viral infection that lab results confirmed wasn't influenza, and after pressing a second clinic they conceded that there weren't even any kits available for Coronavirus testing.
Most are testing positive for influenza or strep.
The main thing it will show is coronavirus is probably about as deadly as regular influenza.
Tested negative for influenza on 03/06 but positive for mononucleosis.
*Sudden* onset of symptoms is apparently more likely to be influenza than COVID-19.
The rapid point-of-care influenza testing devices are known to give higher false-negative results, so it *could* still be influenza, or could be another virus.
Quite a few did test positive for influenza.
Why the fuck are they still giving tamiflu to people who test negative for influenza.
Our retrospective analysis of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in Texas suggests that hospitals had enough ventilators on hand to treat all patients requiring mechanical ventilation throughout the pandemic.
San Antonio leaders are straight up acting like the idiots in 1918 Philadelphia who allowed a huge parade to take place right at the start of the Spanish Influenza and pikachufaced when they had one of the highest death rates in the nation.
Yes, somehow a coronavirus is also influenza.
I got a influenza and strep test first.
This is NOT influenza.
When should I be tested for influenza.
Flu symptoms, dizziness, wheezing in chest and tested negative for Influenza A&B but they said he has some other type of upper respiratory virus but needed Albuterol to clear his lungs.
FYI influenza kills maybe 30k-70k/year.
Influenza is a type of Coronavirus.
Influenza is **NOT** a coronavirus.
Influenza is the term for particular kinds of viruses, just like coronavirus is the term for a different kind of viruses.
Cats are like influenza viruses.
Ergo, influenza viruses and coronaviruses are two completely different kinds of viruses, just like cats and dogs are different kinds of mammels.
The influenza virus causes "the flu" when it infects someone.
My son tested negative for Influenza A & B but has flu symptoms, dizziness, chest pain, cough, runny_nose, wheezing in lungs and they said it's some type of upper respiratory infection and he needed albuterol to clear his lungs.
Since there are four major strains of influenza and catching one doesn't provide immunity to the others, it's probably a safe bet catching one strain of SARS-CoV-19 won't provide immunity to the other.
I live with my 70 year old dad and I'd rather not take the chance of bringing CoVID-19 or general influenza to his doorstep.
Influenza has been around since the 16th century.
1918 Spanish influenza killed up to 100 million, 1957 Asian influenza killed 2 million, Hong Kong influenza killed 1 million in 1968.She is totally better now but was very sick eith flu like symptoms from March 6 - 20.
She tested negative for the flu twice in that time.
Likewise, the Spanish Flu didn't impact the economy because of WWI.
"I can't go to the bar becuz their is a flu??"
The sad part is that the people that believe this is not a big deal will never be convinced...we could reach 5 million infected and they’d still be “but the flu....”
Some people are still comparing this to the flu...I don’t even respond to that.
another question: will this pandemic occur in waves as the "spanish" flu of 1918 did?
If we are lucky, and we don't continue to overwhelm the health system I would say maybe 1.5% with a higher R0, than the 1918 flu.
Spanish flu lasted 3 years.
they are thinking it is more like the flu, right?
This would be applicable even if it were just the normal seasonal flu.
Otherwise try a pharmacy to see if they can at least test for flu/strep.
Im was in a similar boat last week as i couldn't get diagnosed for flu or virus cuz out of flu test and not hospitalized.
They test you for strep first and then flu and then mono and then if those are negative they give you the COVID test.
That’s what I’ve heard, but my doctor wants to do a phone appointment first then get flu and strep tested first I think?
I’m not sick enough for urgent care, I’m going to get a flu and strep test to rule those out first 😰 but it’s not strep and I had a flu shot this year so idk.
I don’t plan on going anywhere as I am quarantining myself, unless a doctor tells me I can go in for a flu test or strep test, so I will be staying home and isolated to my room to keep my family from getting sick also, and I have a small area sanctioned off from them to not  spread any sickness 🙏🏻
You’d at least be able to get the flu & strep test there.
I need to get a flu test and a strep test before they will do the covid test apparently, which is understandable given the shortage they wanna rule out those two, I’ll keep y’all updated with any new info!!
So as far as they are concerned it is just a bad flu and a cure is right around the corner.
Of course it assumes immunity is a thing, that such immunity doesn't fade like with flu and cold, that this virus doesn't evolve, that no other pandemics arise as is predicted as climate continues to overheat etc.
Must be why millions die from Spanish Flu every year, because we never got immunity to it, and it never mutated, oh wait....
It looks at things like uninsured rate, and deaths due to flu / pneumonia to make the rankings.
However virus like common cold and flu all go through mutation and adaptation.
Not to mention all of the closed businesses! Seriously, do people really think governments and businesses would be taking such drastic measures for "just" a flu?
Hell, the Spanish flu was traced back to Kentucky.
It's just like a mild flu".
I needed to get some groceries several times, and the only people who ever almost bumped into me were the stupid grocery store workers who think "it's just the flu".
Then I hear shit like Dan Patrick, or my 80 year old grandparents trying to say it's just the flu and summer will kill it, it's really ungrateful and childish.
Spanish flu killed about 2.75% of the population at the time.
A lot of these workers are still working precisely because they think "it's just the flu", and they're putting all of us at risk.
There was a study done that shows the coronavirus can live on surfaces in 98 degree weather for longer than the flu.
Even his boss laughed it off today saying that this virus is just like the flu.
I work in a hospital, and I'm just going to say that amount of people coming in with shortness_of_breath, cough and flu like symptoms and don't get tested is way higher then this number.
I dont think we will ever know, there has to be many who have had a mild or no symptoms case that thought it was the cold or flu.
Our government will just blame it on "flu" which is why there have been a lot more deaths than average from "flu" this year.
The Jan 2020 pneumonia and flu report for Texas  isn't available to me, I'm not sure if it's me or it hasn't been published yet.
In 2018 there were 3,516 pneumonia/flu related deaths in Texas.
The common cold is like the flu to her and the inevitable finally came to our town today.
Michael Osterholm from infectious disease had said on Joe Rogan's podcast that 95% will get it and only feel a cold or slight flu.
It's easier to spread than flu, but nothing like measles.
H5N1 (bird flu).
highly pathogenic hybrid airborne flu (H1N1+H5N1).
I have a friend that works in a DOCTOR'S OFFICE for christ's sake, and a PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT there was overheard just two days ago saying that she was surprised to learn the coronavirus caused respiratory problems, that up until last weekend she thought it was an intestinal flu.
I worked in a local retail store in Tyler and my house and I both came down with the worst cold/flu ever first week of Jan.
I'm negative for flu and strep.
That they are so overwhelmed from COVID-19, the flu, strep, and allergies that people are literally being turned away to manage at home.
I do think that doctors in the larger communities are probably overly booked as it is our normal cold/flu/strep season as well as the start of spring allergies.
I think especially since I'm high risk the nurse was also trying to make sure I don't sit around for hours to be seen surrounded by sick people because even the actual flu will send me to the ER.
Luckily this seems more like an autoimmune disease flare than anything else but since symptoms can resemble the flu i mentioned it to my boss so I would not needlessly infect others if I was sick.
Did you have this reaction when 60,000,000 Americans were infected and 12,000 died of swine flu?
But half this state thinks its not even as bad as the flu, or a hoax to affect Trump.
Of course, I’m not the one who gave away 75% of our masks and PPE during the Swine Flu I.
At least not for regular flu.
Flu viruses also have different strains.
(The 1st wave of the 1918 Flu was mostly benign.
They’re getting flu meds and don’t have the flu.
So I’ll use care and caution for now and get alarmed when this looks worse than a bad flu season.
I was like, ‘Holy shit, this is not the flu.’ Watching this relatively young guy, gasping for air, pink frothy secretions coming out of his tube and out of his mouth."
San Antonio just does not have enough tests and they are trying to triage the people but we also have high Pollen count causing allergies, the flu, strep, and regular colds going around right now.
My mother and uncle it’s just like the flu.
This is a wake up call for my friends that keep saying this virus is just like the flu.
Thank you! Her grandpa just spent 5 days in the hospital with flu and pneumonia which added to her vigilance.
Many people may mistake it for the flu or a cold.
Some think it’s fake news, Democratic hoax, and just like the flu.
Does anyone not realize we have a global virus outbreak and flu-like symptoms are a result?
Much of the US has been led to think it’s no worse than seasonal flu and there hasn’t been that much on the news about calling before you go to the hospital.
She tested negative for strep and flu, chest xray was clear.
I thought my test was wrong because I KNEW this was the flu.
We were both really worried because we couldn’t believe it wasn’t the flu and we know 10000% it was viral.
The flu but testing negative...I’m wondering if Its possible if I have already had coronavirus?
That said, this could just be the flu but we have large non-traditional student base who commute from Austin & San Antonio.
His nephew Jim has the "flu" now.
Elizabeth hospital's facebook page is full of people presenting with pneumonia, cough, chest pain, breathlessness and negative flu tests.
My husband has been having flu-like symptoms for a few days and I think he might have it.
Negative on Flu A/B.
She never got tested for flu when she was sick though, so...
She said it was the worst flu she ever had although she tested negative for the flu at the doctor's.
The strange part is that my dad and brother went to Urgent care and their flu test came back negative.
Negative tests for flu and strep.
She said she was shocked it wasn’t flu.
People were like "it's just like the flu."
I’ve been following this all day for days because I’m home with coro-ehem, the flu, and have nothing else to do other than chug robitussin, sudafed, and read.
Then it must be just the flu!
That was my concern - news from other countries seems to indicate cold/flu for a week or so, then improvement, then lung/heart problems (heart issues are reported in a lot of serious cases elsewhere but not in the US media it seems).
The heart symptoms are my main concern (worried they’re linked with inflammation/the ‘cytokine storm’ that has been reported from the virus but could be inflammation from flu or something else potentially).
It's because you can pick up infections that are going around while in the hospital (like COVID-19, the flu, etc).
The Federal Government start at the top with Trump have fucked this up so bad, saying everything was under control, and it's no worse than the flu, we should have been preparing and preparing hard in late January, now all we get is fucking Lies and money tossed at us, the lack of early testing allowed this to spread far and wide, by the time we have adequate testing the hospitals will be so inundated it will make Italy look good, and as far as PPE gear, he should have invoked the war time powers long before this and had companies Changing production lines and gearing up to make equipment, but all of this is happening only now when it will takes weeks if not months to ramp up.
they are still uncertain about flu's transmission, and it's been around and studied for a LONG time.
some scientists say flu is transmitted via airborne and some say only by droplets.
I have symptoms, flu test negative, denied testing.
A co workers spouse is very sick, for weeks now, common flu tests negative, wasn't able to be Covid19 tested.
They tested me for flu and strep.
yes, as someone else noted, both the flu and strep tests give lots of false negatives.
it is sounding like flu to me.
The Spanish Flu was a three year cycle (it went around the world 3x) before enough people were immune.
My husband works for Hendrick Hospital, and he said that the ICU was already full with flu cases, just like it is every year around this time.
Even better if this employer gave a heads up that 2 employees were showing flu like symptoms and were waiting for covid test results, but nah, fuck them, need bodies in the building to grind out more money for the company.
Normal flu kills 20K..
he had a serious cold or flu-like illness he got from his kid that he didn't even visit a Dr for for a full month, and kept coming to work and working on patients.
The flu doesn't have vaccines anymore?
Drugs for the flu stopped working?
The flu is difficult to vaccinate for because each virion, each strain, each type is recombinant.
Why is the flu so difficult to vaccinate against and why is there no cure for the common cold.
Common cold is not the flu.
All reasons why the flu is not even close to an appropriate comparison for COVID-19.
The infected will continue to increase exponentially, as will the dead, if this is treated like the flu.
But yeah, the flu, that's a GREAT comparison.
Cause Trump and Fox News have been saying it’s just like the flu.
Almost anything sleep related in the cold/flu section will have it in it.
I was negative for flu, strep, and the whole resp virus pannel...
Nobody showed up at the hospital with flu-like symptoms who had recently returned from China anyway."
Yea a month from now I don't think you will be saying that oh and it's already been proven to be deadlier than the seasonal flu.
We really should've been looking at what various cities were doing during the Spanish Flu pandemic just over a century ago.
A LOT of people in charge are not taking this seriously, and maybe the most scary part of all of it, my boss (like TOO MANY others) believes we can avoid getting sick at all if we are "safe and smart." And if you do get sick, "it's just a flu and it'll be fine." We are so far past all of that.
Agree with everything you said - especially the issue of leaders just not knowing what to do so they default to keeping the status quo and hoping/saying it's just like the flu so no big deal.
Yesterday was my last day on the schedule, and I overheard a client talking to the front desk about how this is just a media conspiracy on an election year and it’s less deadly than the regular flu season we have every year.
(all data listed after this point is based on a YT video linked below) During the Spanish Flu of 1918, Philadelphia ignored warnings and hosted a parade.
Father-in-Law had all the symptoms, negative for both strains of flu.
He had the flu shot for A & B last fall same day I had them.
They (his private doctor, local hospital, Heath Department & CDC were all contacted) flat out told him he didn't need tested for anything he just has the flu because he hasn't been to China.
She had negative flu and strep and they refused to test her for COVID.
The world doesn’t go on shutdown for the flu.
No way they are all not infected, and since these patients test neg for flu we are caring for them with NO PPE.
I had a weird tickle in my nasal passage that reminded me of when I had the flu the other day.
and if they come back negative flu..
These same people are also at a high risk with the regular old flu.
So true! And then there are people I know (friends friends colleagues husband) who have flu like symptoms, asked to quarantine at home by ED, on full pay by employer to work from home and still don’t want to stay home coz they are bored of quarantine and believe that a quick trip out won’t hurt! I am sitting home hoping that God shows them the right thing to do and they chose not to go out :(
Well originally he was just given Tamiflu, which is for a normal household flu.
It's what cost the lives of 4500 in Philadelphia in a single week amidst the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918/19.
I'm young, the youngest in my office and since I'm unfortunate enough to live in the state taking it the least serious, I'm sure many, many people believe the "it's only a flu" or "only old people need to worry" lies.
It's gonna be like that, people won't take it seriously and believe it's just a flu and try and go about their lives normally.
If you know how to take care of yourself when you are hit with the flu, and you are not in the high risk age.
damn i faked the swine flu to avoid practice in 9th grade.
Statistically that's worse than the flu, so don't mistake me for "it's just a flu bro".
Edit: they tested negative for flu and strep.
I am just biding my time and when all of the deniers, the "but the flu kills more", the "but we don't got that here" naysayers realize the magnitude of their mistake and error in judgement.
iT's JuSt ThE fLu!
Mild winter and flu season = combo.
Me too! I had the flu about 3- 4 weeks ago,  and am still coughing (this is in no way unusual for me).
She went from "it's just a flu" and now she's scared and has been assigned to the coronavirus ward in Galveston.
They told me they at least 4 employees out sick with the "flu" and insist it's not a problem...
They are saying anything below that could be pnemonia or "flu-like" and I'd definitely keep trying to get tested.
It’s a nose swab similar to how you get checked for the flu.
I am amazed at the number of people that are still saying " It's Just the Flu".
It is most definitely NOT just the FLU.
Even then I feel like the “it’s just the flu” people have never had the actual flu.
Even then, no one fucking WANTS the flu either, Karen!
This isn't the flu.
This virus will be with us for years to come just like the flu, it will evolve to survive, but altleast by then there will be a medication to reduce and prevent.
My spouses work still thinks it’s no worse than a common cold/flu.
If that level of stupidity is still going on in Washington, then I have no hope the people in my small town are going to stop blaming the "Democratic media" for hyping up a flu.
He refused to get a flu shot last year even though they had a newborn that wasn’t old enough to be vaccinated.
He still refuses to admit that he’s the one who brought it home to the baby, even though he had the flu, wife didn’t because of vaccination, and she’s a stay-at-home mom.
I caught it from a roommate who has been sick for 17 days and who tested negative for flu.
This is an example of the state and federal governments saying it’s just the flu bro....
Yes the flu kills more, but comparing the rates, this virus kills more than the flu.
Based on the data, COVID-19 spreads more easily than the flu.
2/26, on Friday 2/28 and Saturday 2/29 I was flat on the couch with "flu-like" symptoms.
On Sunday, March 1st the "flu-like" situation went from a little cough, tight chest, sore throat, to super productive cough.
in respective cities and tested negative for flu and strep throat.
yes I took Theraflu ExpressMax severe cold and cough night and day formula Then Mucinex cold and flu plus Ricola candy looking things.
When the major flu symptoms reduced the big productive cough started I switched mostly to Mucinex 12 hour expectorant tablets and took Advil.
I got tested for flu though and got lucky.
When the major cold and flu symptoms reduced and the big productive cough started I switched mostly to Mucinex 12 hour expectorant tablets and took Advil.
The numbers that say it's similar to the flu have been proven wrong.
According to china the fatality is about twice that of the flu.
The flu has a vaccination, this does not, and will not have one for at least another year.
The diseases that kill at higher rates are monstrosities-it's right behind diphtheria and botulism and a head of the Spanish flu.
Its going to be alot harder to convince 'Its Only the Flu' crowd into social distancing and staying at home when we have only a few positive cases trickling in.
Two weeks ago they announced, it's just the flu..
Oh no you get a cold or flu for a few days.
A few years ago during a bad flu season a cashier at HEB was wearing gloves and I mentioned to her I wish more people did that.
it’s basically describing the same thing as flu lol.
Even if you just had bronchitis or the flu you could still infect your parents, and nobody wants to take a 3 hour drive when they're sick.
It could be the flu.
A lot of people think this is just a flu and that I'm overreacting.
And it’s fucking frustrating!!! Everyone in the area is taking it as a joke because “it doesn’t affect me” or “oh it’s just the flu it’s not even that bad, it only kills old people” like how selfish you have to be to think that way.
I made the decision to stay home when my manager told everyone that it was like a mild flu and i work at a post office facility,The manager who is an idiot among other things then immediately left the facility .
There are cases in the hospitals already, but they are labeled "flu" cases and are taken care of in negative pressure rooms with a dedicated nurse.
And we'd only see the whole picture if it was possible for everyone to be tested and those who recovered/died from pnuemonia or had flu-like illness/flu-negative in the last ~2.5 months.
Remind that remote villages got the Spanish flu.
Most people are not thinking of numbers because of FLU comparison.
Those not following this bug had a reality check when the free market reacted forcing the president to stop the it's just the flu bro meme...
Then it was no worse than the flu.
It's just the flu.
Just wondering, did you or your wife go anywhere to get tested first for the flu prior to the drive thru testing??
A couple of friends came home from NYC Bronx and new Rochelle, got sick, tested for flu and strep and tested negative.
And meet certain criteria even after testing negative for strep and flu.
Yeah, it’s insane all the amount of people getting hit with emergency flu screenings and being denied the Coronavirus test.
It’s very much “just a flu bro, fake news”.
I only know a few people who AREN'T in the "flu is worse" crowd.
I talked to a ‘Flu, bro’ at work and I asked him one question.
My aunt texted me last night that she doesn't get the hysteria since it's just the flu.
Her daughter tested positive for flu A this morning.
Very likely to be the flu.
The flu can endanger those who may also contract COVID-19.
This being cold and flu season on top of this stupid virus panic makes it so much worse.
Coronavirus symptoms come on gradually, flu is a rapid onset.
Sounds more like flu than Covid19 to me.
My manager wasn’t concerned about it before, and still isn’t! The narrative changed from “it’s a flu” to “if you get it, you’ll survive it.” Seriously?!?
Now it's "this is all BS it's just the flu bro only old people die" stuff and calling it media driven frenzy.
Before you scream "but they are saying patient zero is now identified as early as Nov 17", no, they found that out NOW since they are backtracking through all the mild cases trying to find the initial cause, nobody knew the dry cough person is not having a common flu in November.
On Sunday, he was admitted to the hospital with flu symptoms.
It quotes the death toll of  the Spanish Flu and compares it to Coronavirus.
Of course, that is the  total from the end of the Spanish Flu outbreak, whereas we are arguably  still relatively early in this one.
Also,  the Flu death toll, while accurate, underplays the issue.
seen in heavily hit areas,  comparisons that make this seem like something milder than the flu don't  seem quite right.
Flu testing is  also used to track trends, not just "to give a pill" like stated in this  post.
Local schools have temporarily closed to stop the spread of the  flu in my area before.
"Just do  what you've always done  during cold/flu season." - This, to most  people, implies that it's business as usual and that canceling of large  events, social distancing, etc.

Still quoting 20K dead last year from flu...
They gave me a flu test, a strep test, and a full respiratory panel.

To give someone a flu test, they have to get a swabbed.

Carmel started exhibiting mild flu-like symptoms.
She tested negative for the flu yesterday and was then tested for COVID-19.

He probably thought it was a cold or the flu and went on with life as usual until recently.
I had flu from overseas in last January, from a country that could not have had nCov yet.
It's *probably* flu.
Covid-19 cases will expand dramatically, very soon, but until then you are far more likely to have flu.
Hospitals frequently run at or almost at capacity, particularly in the flu season (ie now).
I’m not one to get sick either, usually once a year at most with the last time I had the flu being 5 years ago.
I'm not saying I'm one of those people who think this is "stupid and the flu kills more people, etc." because frankly, I'm freaking the hell out and have quarentined myself due to a sore throat.
I think the death rate probably isn’t as high as numbers are saying, but it does seem to be much deadlier than the flu.
But it’s still a respiratory virus and I think to be panicked about this but completely ignore how deadly the flu also is every year is nonsensical, because a LOT of people get very sick and die of the flu every year.
This isn’t “just the flu.”
In the face of a long flu season, multiple other respiratory viruses, and allergy season, for someone who has extremely mild disease (for instance a dry cough, maybe a few chills), it is easy to write it off as a cold/allergies and go about your daily business....and then infect others who may not be as lucky symptom-wise.
Once again Feb 4 same as Jan 21st, but its gone now I can't but wonder if that was the Corona Virus or just regular flu.

In NYC during the 1918 flu they kept the schools open, it's believed they saved many lives by doing so ('Pale Rider', Laura Spinney).
The Flu of 1918 infected 1/3 of all people and had a mortality rate of 3%.
Just like the 1918 flu.
It's not just the flu bro.

A flu, which is what we generally compare it to might infect 30M-120M Americans in a year.

After seeing the US numbers, listening to the president saying “it’s just the flu” a day ago (I’ve read enough from Iranian, Italian, and Chinese Drs/nurses to know it’s not the flu),  the selfishness of many Americans, and the fact a lot of Americans get News from Facebook memes and believe it, I am going to take a guess that our hospitals are completely overrun around the country in several weeks and that most people will be changing their tune about it.

Again, yes, it's fuckin shit to only test the people who have had such specific contact with the handful of known patients, but the fact of the matter is that, until we've got more equipment and infrastructure to test, we've got a very limited amount of resources, and it's way more likely that lives will be saved by building a map of cases from known origin points in order to get information on where the virus is, how bad it spreads in certain areas/environments, and where they might need to bolster equipment and staff and wherever else in preparation for a localized outbreak that they might be able to see coming from a week or two out rather than being blasted with a tsunami of tests that even when tested positive yield hardly any more information than "okay yeah this person got told to go home and not cough on stuff."

Humans do not build much immunity to the common cold corona viruses that circulate yearly for example, and I’ve seen nothing but caution being preached from professionals that are involved in studying such things.
Just like the cases are the result of viral cases + antibody tests (which it even states you could test positive for the COVID family of viruses which includes a common cold).
The results suggest “one reason that a large chunk of the population may be able to deal with the virus is that we may have some small residual immunity from our exposure to common cold viruses,” says viral immunologist Steven Varga of the University of Iowa.
With asthma even a common cold sets it off so I agree.
It’s like saying we can build up a herd immunity for the common cold or the flu.

We don’t have a cure for the common cold but you still recover from that.
Covid-19 is far worse than the common cold.
“Some other viruses in the coronavirus family, such as those that cause common colds, tend to induce immunity that is relatively short-lived, at around three months,” says Peter Openshaw at Imperial College London.
Seven strains of human coronaviruses are known, of which four produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold:
The contagiousness of Coronavirus, or R0, is slightly more than 2, putting it as 1/3 as contagious as the common cold.
There is no cure for the common cold is the saying, is it not?
I’m definitely sick and I’m just slowly inching towards better, which isn’t usually how I respond to a common cold.
These types of viruses cause a few of the common colds, MERS, and SARS.
not even that, people who actually have it have the possibility of shrugging it off as the common cold, don't underestimate how dumb some people are.
You can also spread the flu or the common cold but we don't cancel events for them.
We have more people getting sick and requiring hospitalization of what we seasonally have with the common cold and flu.
Do you have a source where the CDC is saying it's no big deal, just treat it like the flu or common cold?

Yeah, I think sneezing and runny_noses isn't a very common symptom although sneezing can spread the virus if you're infected which means it's worth keeping your allergies in check.

Was hoping to avoid watching it again due to nausea.
They've screwed the pooch, but that doesn't mean they can't/won't make it worse with a "AZ is different so lets wait and see approach." Makes me nauseated.
He woke me up around 3:42am and took me to emergency room, where I was given meds to help with nausea and pain.
Unbearable nausea.
Nauseating process.
Whereas older media types claim the younger people in the newsroom are so convinced that words equal violence that they’re all in for censorship, a bit like being a waiter who’s nauseated by food.
That's fucking nauseating.
Having lived in WTX my entire life, the amount of unashamed ignorance being demonstrated toward this pandemic is nauseating.

It reminding me of vomiting when there is nothing left but you continue to wretch.
No matter how many times Italians try to tell our politicians that they have to act swiftly and do everything they can to stay AHEAD of this shit, they keep vomiting up the same old "low risk at this time" bullshit.
Oh, that’s right [INDUCES VOMITING].

I am not admin but our non icu, non worst-case Covid patients aren’t being handled by an abundance of extra staff and resources, the unit we have set up for covid now is mostly business as usual but I do understand the point that it’s not exactly the same as a senior with minor chest pain.

You will experience a lot of body ache and downright pain from your waist down.
The Togo only was a pain at first but we streamlined it and made it go pretty smooth and I feel like at some point soon we will be back to that position of no more dine in.

I'm not a healthcare worker and don't want to spread misinformation but 3 people who are close to me all had a mystery illness that lasted about a month and included chest pain but none of them were ever diagnosed with anything.
it makes sense, because all folks have different systems, they're taking different meds, have different/no/many pre-existing conditions some of which we know make the disease worse, others of which, we won't know about until later, because we tend to not think about how pretty much all folks with pre-existing conditions are at least slightly immuno-supressed, if not fully immunocompromised, purely by nature of your body constantly having to deal with chronic illness, believe me as someone with two chronic pain conditions and epilepsy, as well as multiple comorbidities of the psychiatric variety, it's fucking EXHAUSTING but then getting adequate nutrition, sleep, exercise etc can also feel impossible because existing is hard.
My adult son’s schedule II medication got filled with a 90 day supply last week, and my NP friend who works in pain management said they were gearing up to do telemedicine on patients with fentanyl patches (which also require monthly visits) so I would think it is absolutely worth asking.
My wife just did a televisit with her pain doc yesterday and they called in her refill.
At this point, everyone will feel the pain one way or another and we will get through it together.

However, his own inaction and blocking of municipal and county laws have resulted in the sickness of tens of thousands;  the deaths of hundreds; and real economic pain to many.
I understand your pain.

If his family is hurt by people discussing his actions, that pain is on him.
He was responsible for preventing that pain.

Just went today, i went to 3 Walmart’s today and all of them had lower than usual stock for canned goods, non-perishables and absolutely nothing for toilet paper/sanitizer.
Lysol wipes [contain].
One way to go about it would be to select another product that is entirely quats (look for 'benzyl ammonium chloride' in the names, with nothing else funky like hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, etc.), and then dilute it to get the same concentration as Lysol wipes.
I wiped down the items with Lysol, wore a mask the entire time, Purelled my hands afterward.
Non perishables stay in the garage for a few days and then still get wiped down/sprayed with Lysol.
I think all we can really do at this point is to wear the mask, wash the hands, utilize Lysol, teach your kids to wash hands properly, eat healthy, reduce stress by not watching the news as much (at least for me anyways)....
From what I've read they can be neutralized for non-medical/personal use by ~158 degree (IIRC) oven heat for 30 min or 10 min close steam without damaging the filter material like lysol etc probably would.
Meanwhile  I stopped at Target to buy some more multi-surface cleaner (not for doomsday prepping purposes but because we are out of cleaner lol) and toilet paper, paper towels, and Lysol are all in short supply.
I also make sure I always have a thin film of santizer on me at all times and been using Lysol spray as perfume.
Everything that comes into my house gets bleached, Lysol’d or quarantined for 24 hours.
Not sure if there is anything other than lysol wipes, mask that you can't find.
Currently we are using Lysol on all boxes before opening and wiping down all products with disinfecting wipes.
I made the desperate decision to go to the store for this item only, using the only face_mask I have and a pair of rubber gloves, hand sanitizer and Lysol at the ready.
The rule is he immediately heads straight to the shower, Lysol's his work clothes before they go in the bin, and comes out with clean 'home' clothes.
But they do take longer for kill times, and you should not use anything but a microfiber cloth with them, otherwise you will diluted the solution (Lysol is like this, FYI).
It would take 20 minutes of sunlight to do what lysol does (99.9% killed).
Our school supplies list always ask for kids to bring either Lysol wipes or germx and with the lack of the product now I’m wondering how we will manage when we return to school.
Like as if they were going to pump Lysol w/gain scent into the congregation.
After they did their part, I sprayed Lysol, wiped down all surfaces (and key) with hand sanitizer, then drove home (masked) with the windows down.
It wouldn't be a blatant email blast or announcement at the morning meeting saying "Timmy Joe's wife Tillie has the Rona, so please mock him and spray him with Lysol" but rather a more discreet "guys, this virus sucks and someone has been in close contact with a known positive case.
Then, after he leaves, you put in some gloves and Lysol down all groceries you just received.
At this point my GF and I spray lysol all over our Amazon stuff.
It would \*almost\* be worth it to carry a can of Lysol.
Just Lysol the air between you and them.
2020 in a nutshell...I'm gonna yeet this can of Lysol at you to avoid a virus originating from a Chinese person eating a bat because you felt like your civil liberties were infringed by being asked to wear a mask.

People dying because they literally injected Lysol into their veins in 3-2-1.
Is this like......an effort to have his die hard supporters melt themselves in hopped up tanning beds while huffing Lysol?
snorting lysol starts when?
The Lysol challenge!!!!
I swear to all that's unholy, if we see a headline about people dying because they mainlined Lysol, we need to bring this asshole up on charges.
Edit: Clorox and Lysol are both trending on Twitter...
Up until a couple of days ago I’d straight up would refuse to let my cat even enter my room because I would worry about him picking up the virus in his fur off a spot of the floor I might have missed, or from the carpet (because I have no idea how effective the Lysol spray actually is on it), then tracking it onto my bed and into my sheets.
Lysol.
A can goes everywhere with me at work, the grocery store, the bathroom, the break room, Lysol has became my significant other, my new BFF.
Anything boxed gets lysol'd on the outside.
If it weren't for them I'd have nothing to sanitize with because people bought all the lysol and clorox wipes back in February.
Gloves, lysol, set for 10 mins and reapply gloves.
I don't think the Lysol is even necessary.
gloves and lysol aren't that cheap.
Lysol spray.
* No antibacterial, lysol products or toilet paper to buy.
Whatever we bought is either sprayed/wiped down with lysol, or put in the garage for 72 hours.
It would really be something crazy for you to get it from a single lysoled exposure on some groceries.
Lysol the groceries.
I ended up choosing to lysol the shit out of them, letting them dry on the rack and rinsing them out before stacking them back up.
Keep a can of Lysol on you at all times/spray.
Stay safe guys, wash_your_hands, social distancing, Lysol spray your surfaces and doorknobs.
I’m thinking it may be all the Lysol I’ve been spraying around the house though (maybe it’s what’s happening to you too).
I buy, drop at front porch, Lysol it all.
I do make him wash his hands and I Lysol his shoes by the front door when he comes home but I feel like he's gonna be the one who brings it home.
He makes people sit in back now, douses everything in Lysol after passengers and doesn't shake hands anymore.
I work from my house so I’m trying not to leave the house at all but I had a craving for something specific and thought if I brought Lysol wipes and all that good stuff and just kept my distance I would be fine.
Spray Lysol like a madman/woman.

Disinfectant wipes but a sponge in dilute pinesol would work too.
Respect! They are supposed to be disposable, after all! Also, disinfecting wipes at the entrance, I always like to take one and use it throughout my shopping session.
When I ask where are the wipes, they give some sort of a hospital excuse — this has been the experience in several stores, so, it must be a company-wide propaganda to tell to customers.
Am I supposed to be impressed they’re putting my community at risk by failing to secure the wipes and/or claiming to donate them to hospitals?
BTW, I was praising Walmart a few days ago earlier in this very thread; well, the exact same store (Anderson Ln) didn't have any disinfectant wipes anymore just a couple of days later (the other WM store always had it a couple of weeks ago on every single visit); and an exit checker didn't have a mask covering her nose, whilst standing closer than 6' to the exit.
So far, Trader Joe's is the only place to have disinfectant wipes on all visits; however, the Rollingwood location thought it'd be a great idea to place two huge fans to blow air directly onto the line of customers (because hot/humid day); where many customers are playing with their dirty underwear right in front of you, and not wearing any, because who wears the underwear when you're outside?

N95_masks, sometimes known as N95 respirators, are not the same thing as loose-fitting surgical masks.
N95_masks are tight-fitting and filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.

A massive lie that had people fighting over toilet paper instead of  N95_masks that Trump was shipping to his pals in china
This experiment did not include N95_masks and does not reflect the actual transmission of infection from patients with COVID-19 wearing different types of masks.
Further, the government should provide every American with an N95_mask and that would actually stop the spread of the virus if they are as good as people say.
Adams also said that N95 respirator masks aren’t as effective for the general public as one might think, saying N95_masks “have to get fit-tested.”
As if employers can purchase ppe or N95_masks.
Best: N95_masks.
An N95_mask that you haven't been fit tested for is going to do not a damn thing, which a lot of people who wear them fail to realize.
I've failed many N95_mask fit tests, both quantitative and qualitative.
*An N95_mask that you haven't been fit tested for is going to do not a damn thing*
Speaking as someone who has worked in industrial environments and worn various kinds of dust masks and respirators, and several different kinds of N95, an average sized adult will be protected by an N95_mask without being "fit tested" for it.
the koch's who have been closing paper mills because of the EPA, they funded the AstroTurfing campain for DJT and they get to break the EPA rules ZERO ENFORCEMENT hence allowing them to open the mills back up without having to replace $200,000,000 in  equipment  and WOW there is a FAKE PANIC created and MAD HOUSE RUSH for toilet paper instead of N95_masks to save ones life...
I have an old N95_mask I pulled from our garage but I’m worried people will think I’m hoarding medical resources and judge the shit out of me if they see me rocking one.
On the other hand if they wore a mask and you did, the amount of virus in the air and how much you breath in will be MUCH less if any depending on of both had properly fitting N95_masks.
The ones I've seen show the N95 and KN95_masks as around 95% effective, surgical masks a bit less effective, and cloth masks about 60% effective.
I would love an N95_mask but obviously that’s not possible.
Most global factories are based in China including the American company 3M that makes N95_masks most healthcare workers are desperately trying to get.
The few clinics that are still in existence do not have ventilators or N95_masks as part of their regular practice.
I bet they are not real N95_masks, but counterfeit.
People with it definitely fucking should FFS! Aaaaaaand as I say all this I know it’s useless because I wore a mask yesterday to H-E-B with my partner and both of us got strange looks the whole time, told we were promoting this conspiracy and also told we should give our six year old N95_masks previously used for paint jobs and ceramic work to hospitals in need.
Rambling point being we were not the only ones wearing them but I guess it seemed like because they were N95_masks folks got extra pissy.
Responding to swine flu, which the CDC estimated killed more than 12,000 people in the United States over the course of a year, had required the largest deployment in the stockpile’s history, including nearly 20 million pieces of personal protective equipment and more than 85 million N95_masks, according to a 2016 report published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.
The article is hot garbage and does not say its true, it links to another one of their hot garbage articles claiming "The stockpile had just 16,600 of the breathing machines and an estimated 12 million N95_masks at the start of the pandemic – not enough for those two states, much less the rest of the country.
Same answer for the same question: N95_masks, gowns, and vents.
The N95_mask can be made practically anywhere as long as it is in a certified facility.
Because of the process and treatment of the material used for N95_masks, it’s practically impossible to make at home.
Nope there are no N95_masks available for the public or most doctors but if there were it could happen.
You don't need a mass produced N95_mask to reduce the spread.
There's been an article about a proposed legislation to make the whole thing uniform, and make better preparation for the potential pandemic, by getting extra N95_masks, but it didn't pass:
I have a dozen or so N95_mask but all I use now are industrial half face mask with N95 or P95 or P100 filters.
It's bad be safe stay home 99.5% of people dont have N95_masks to protect us, it's insane we surpassed china in infected people
[Stanford determined that cooking masks at 70°C for 30min would adequately disinfect N95_masks]
I mean I just read an article about Stanford finding out the temperature and time to oven bake N95_masks until they are sterile.
But we don’t have enough N95_masks for health care professionals.
then the N95_masks can be saved for health care professionals.
The nurses who did the swab has N95_masks on and.
since trump lied about millions of N95_masks being delivered a week ago.
An N95_mask will reduce your chances of getting it.
Only the N95_masks will prevent any intake of potentially infected air.
Your N95_mask isn't covering that.
I have both respirator/plague masks and regular N95_masks.
N95_masks reduce by 95%.
Masks don't work *perfectly*, but even non N95_masks likely help - especially by preventing spread from the asymptomatic (or more often mildly symptomatic) carrier.
I did manage to snag some N95_masks back in January, however.
PM me when you have sugar cravings, I will trade you fresh cookies for N95_masks ;) Better than going out to the crazy crowds.
As my wife refuses to let me by N95_mask in January, "until it's at my front door"....now its here with an imunsurpresent wife with no protection.
Buy a N95_mask on amazon or EBay to protect yourself.
N95_masks can keep you safe from getting the virus.
I know several offices who not only can’t get access to N95_masks, they can’t even get surgical masks.
To clarify: N95_masks are helpful for those who are sick and for healthcare professionals (they are generally fitted for specific people).
N95_mask are helpful.
I was talking about the standard non-N95_masks that people are wearing on airplanes, etc.
Particular industry sectors are having their orders fulfilled by distributors, however N95_masks and or respirators and or those that exceed that rating are controlled items in the US by order of the government.
My wife keeps N95_masks with disposable filters around all the time as a "just in case", as do my in-laws.
They told the nurses that they were going to hold off on N95_masks and to just not go in the room and give care.
I wear an N95 and goggles around EVERYONE (even fellow staff.).
If you recall a story about Robert Kraft using the Patriots' team plane to bring N95s to Massachussetts, he did it to help to state get the masks without the feds taking them.
Envomask makes a reusable N95 mask that's NIOSH certified and available for purchase.
Make sure to select the KN95 style.
Like N95s, it is important to maintain a proper fit with the KN95.
A simple and thin cloth mask can be used as an outer cover to help keep your KN95 clean.
N95 or kn95?
There were also valved N95 masks but those shouldn’t be used.
How much are K/N95 masks now?
I was just at Fry's Electronics in Tempe this afternoon, they had piles of KN95s, I think it was $25 for 10.
[Arun KN95] .
I've been wearing my N95 mask since March and obviously will continue to do so.
A friend of mine that works in medical gave me an N95 back in April.
Some are comfortable with a mask, some wear N95's, some wear a shield.
We can't even ensure we'll have proper PPE or sanitization, because you can't buy the stuff (N95 masks are still basically nonexistent, even after all this time - it's insane).
Masks:  I'm sure you're well aware, but days ago, the CDC stated the masks with valves are not nearly as effective as other N95 masks due to the fact you're breathing in your own air.
Just in case you didn't know and have masks like these, best to grab the regular N95ers WITH NO VALVE attached to them.
We are still reusng N95s and can only wear them for 'aerosolizing procedures'.
Example: When SARS stroke China at 2003, Chinese people cannot afford N95 or even surgical mask, so they can only wear gauze masks.
They change the wording, sometimes it's N95, R95, P100, or KN95.
N95s are a lot harder to find these days, so be aware of counterfeits or scam.
[FDA] released a list of KN95/N95 manufacturers that are Emergency Use Authorized (EUA).
For masks like KN95 and N95, it's better to go off with the NPPTL assessment since they have the proper equipment to test the BFE or PFE.
If you are looking for a legitimate KN95 supplier, check out this [store] The KN95 they have is back up by FDA EUA and NPPTL.
I have plenty of N95s thank you very much.
N95 is 95% and P100 is 97%
But without that, even w a N95 mask and other PPE, still seems risky.
The N95 greatly reduces but doesn't completely eliminate risk of infection.
Hopefully the N95 gets the job done !
Believe he was wearing a N95.
Are they providing you N95 or higher face mask and eye protection?
There's a reason countless front line medical personnel have been infected despite N95 masks often being worn.
She told me yesterday that her coworker has been using the same N95 mask for 4 months.
N95 is rarely an issue at this point, they all restocked weeks ago.
Would an FDA medical emergency approved KN95 work for you?
Hi! Please look into EnvoMask which is a reusable N95 with replaceable filters.
Fry's Electronics has [these] KN95s.
If you buy a [R95] you get the same protection with N95.
I'm not crazy about their gun-nuttiness, but their masks are a good fit and have replaceable N95 filters.
If you can't get N95, get the cheaper alternatives, KN95 or KF94.
I got 5 KN95 masks for $20 from green supply.com (I believe they sell higher quantities also).
* [Project N95].
I just purchased 30 KN95 masks for $80 shipped.
These are made by Powecom, which is an FDA approved manufacturer for medical emergency KN95 masks.
They will only provide N95 if you are performing an aersol generating procedure.
Oh and we haven't had N95 fit testing yet.
“Additional analysis in health care settings found that N95 respirators were 96% effective at protecting workers in these settings, while other types of masks (such as surgical masks) were 77% effective.”
“Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in healthcare workers during non–aerosol‐generating care.
Preservation of N95 respirators for high‐risk, aerosol‐generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply.”
There was a study done to see how reusable N95 masks are and they were putting them in ovens at 250 degrees for over 30 min or something.
She wore military goggles, an N95 mask, gloves, and didn't touch anything at all in her history of going to walmart.
They were not sure if the supply of N95 masks would be sufficient for health care workers, and they were fearful that Americans might make a run on masks thus depleting the essential supply much like they ran on toilet paper.
They were not sure if the supply of N95 masks.
They're not talking about asking nonmedical people to wear N95 masks, however.
Of course N95s will protect the user as these are the only masks designed with a filter small enough to trap those particles.
Wearing an N95 for hours at a time is brutal, let me tell you.
Since one literally says that surgical masks can be as effective as N95 at filtering aerosols.
Another says that in non-aerosol producing medical situations, which I'd imagine you could apply to non-medical situations as well since the risk is much lower outside medical situations,  medical masks can be as effective as N95.
They all have N95 and surgical masks for everyone.
Thankfully I'm in healthcare so I have an N95 mask, but goddamn.
I've also got N95s, face_shields, gowns, hair nets...
I believe science, too, and I know that, unless it's a heavy-duty gas mask or an N95, your mask isn't gonna protect you from 40 mouth breathers not wearing masks.
If it’s not N95 he’s not protecting himself, just others.
If it is an N95, that is a precious resource and can be seized by the federal government.
Air Force One is scheduled to land at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Tuesday morning so Trump can visit a nearby Honeywell facility that has shifted from manufacturing aircraft propulsion engines to making N95 respirator masks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
yayyy do I win a proper fitting N95 mask?
* N95 Respirators (Masks).
Arizona's largest health system is for the first time telling employees to reuse their highly protective N95 masks in an effort to conserve a precious resource.
The health system, which has medical facilities in six states, has enough N95 masks on hand to last 14 days at normal capacity.
N95 masks, sometimes known as N95 respirators, are not the same thing as loose-fitting surgical masks.
N95 masks are tight-fitting and filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.
All FDA-cleared N95 respirators are labeled as "single-use," disposable devices, but Bessel said the COVID-19 pandemic is a situation where the rules on N95 masks are changing at Banner as they have in other hospitals and health systems.
[You can decontaminate your N95 up to 50 times.].
I nuke my N95 for 10 seconds when I come home.
I used a mask (regular one, not N95) at the grocery store today.
Real talk: there's no way homemade masks can be as good as the N95 masks made by 3M, right?
They too are seeing an influx and have no N95's so she's refused to work the last 4 shifts because she's afraid to bring it home to her 11 month old.
I've heard that using pieces of non-fiberglass air filters as filter inserts in cotton masks is better than nothing but not 100% the same as something like a N95.
An N95 or P100 mask with a proper seal absolutely will protect you.
Prob impossible to get N95 or P100 now.
When I do go out (which I only do to pick up my prescription) I wear a KN95 mask.
He's had to go in for a few meetings in the office, not by choice, and wore KN95s and sanitized the crap out of everything he could.
I wear an N95 mask in public, I use hand sanitizer before and after going inside, I only leave home 1-2 times a month, I get groceries delivered and I don’t go in anywhere that has more than 3 people inside.
jesus christ, wear an elastical N95 mask.
I found some that have a tiny, flexible wire in one edge so you can form fit it around your nose and cheeks, sort of like a lite version of the N95 nose clips.
The vast majority of people don’t have access to N95s.
N95 is the ideal, but I don't think it's expected, especially not outdoors.
I'm not saying that there's a difference in the open air factor, just that unless you're in close contact to someone you know has the virus, my understanding is that you really don't need an N95 in the open air.
You do need a mask, mind you, but in the open air with a basic mask, and observing basic social distancing (which I know that the people in the picture aren't doing, I'm just talking about when I understand N95s to be needed) my understanding is that your odds of contracting the virus are relatively low.
He wears an N95 mask, carries wipes and hand sanitizer, and has kept to 6 feet distancing.
You can see it in his bizarre infantile expressions, his inability to put on gloves or N95 masks, or form complete thoughts.
Don't go out and mingle with morons unless you have no choice and then wear a N95 mask if you can get one.
Not only that but I recall clearly the overwhelming opinion on Reddit was people armchair claiming definitively that a simple non medical mask would in no way offer any protection and that only an N95 or better mask would help at all and even then if properly pressed in and used.
I myself used to get weird looks when I'd walk into the grocery store with an N95 on back in early February so im glad its normal now and I don't stick out as much for wearing them in crowded indoor spaces.
They didn't increase production of ventilators or N95 masks (in fact they stole them and forced hospitals to acquire them secretly to ensure they didn't get taken).
I found a couple of N95’s in survival kits that I ordered.
[FDA] released a list of N95/KN95 manufacturers that are Emergency Use Authorized (EUA).
If you are looking for a legitimate KN95 supplier, check out this [store] The KN95 they have is on the FDA EUA list and NPPTL.
A very reasonable alternative at the individual level is to have N95s and wear them at work.
If N95s are not available then there are ways to craft a reasonable substitute using cloth masks and HEPA filters cut to size.
Wearing an N95 with it sucks but I can do it if I stay calm and make appropriate use of my inhalers/ exercise therapy.
Separate from this article I posted a video online of myself training with kettlebells in an N95 so others could see it was at least possible.
Invest in KN95 masks for higher risk situations.
Get N95 bare minimum and eye coverings.
Did all the medical staff who you came within 6 ft of within the hospital wore a surgical or N95 mask?
I have a couple of N95 masks from a job a couple of years ago.
Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability >95%, low certainty). 
Do you have a N95 you can wear, and then a surgical over it?
I don’t have an N95.
Do you know where I can get an N95?
It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it's better that an N95 and will last for over 40 hours of use according to 3M.
I spend roughly 3/4 of each day in an N95 respirator - but I'm averaging 1-2 N95s per month due to continued shortages, and we lack the proper equipment to fit-test them.
He still needs to increase test availability, order mandatory quarantining when tested positive or exposed to someone positive, Apple/Google contact tracing, and get Texans some N95 masks.
Btw, the KN95 masks are not particularly very good, they're very hit and miss in terms of quality  but a single mask is not ideal in any case because even in ideal conditions they only block 95% of particulate matter.
There's also nurses like me who we just don't have N95's that fit me anymore.
I can't even work those floors anymore as the new N95's we got don't fit.
About the mask though, I'll rock a KN95 mask honestly to protect myself and don't mind wearing it when interacting with others, but I don't see myself sitting at a restaurant for a very long time.
* Government getting enough N95s.
But real N95s.
* The federal government needs to get off its ass, mandate production of PPE like N95 masks.
GNC has a shit load of N95 mask!
For N95's, you can add your email to be notified when stock becomes available on some websites -
KN95's are widely available - Amazon, Menards, etc - but not all are NIOSH approved.
KN95 is the Chinese standard & equivalent to the US N95 -
My pharmacist carries N95s and other tight fitting disposables.
I buy the lesser ones to leave N95s for those who are more at risk.
Just about every convenience store I walk into has adequate masks short of N95.
Vogmask makes stylish reusable N95 masks.
Some of their masks failed testing by a few percent but IMO for all practical purposes they're basically KN95.
Amazon - KN95 Masks.
Surgical and N95 will definitely provide some safety to the wearer.
I wouldn’t want a N95, since I know the hospitals need those.
KN95...
I work for a company that imports and helps supply PPE products and KN95 are going to be your best bet.
I would try to order them off of Amazon or Aliexpress but you need to be careful because a lot of the KN95s that were tested were faulty and didn't pass filtration tests.
I wish I could, but I'm blind like most when it comes to KN95 - they all look shady to me too.
KN95s are the Chinese equivalent of N95s.
Just get the N95 if you see them/find them.
For a classeoom N95/N100 is the least I would recommend.
N95 masks are in short supply, and hospitals need them for their nurses and doctors.
Surgical masks are far more abundant than N95 masks.
N95 masks showed no statistically significant difference in how well they protected against airborne infectious droplets (influenza was the infection of interest, but the mechanism of spreading is the same as COVID-19: airborne droplets).
A droplet is exceedingly unlikely to duck and weave its way through the three or four layers of fibers of the mask, even if it is not technically as efficient as N95.
N95 - 99.98% effective at blocking spread of aerosols (these are of course the microscopic "droplets" that spread covid).
Regarding masks specifically even non N95 grade see this article from the AoIM:   and its referenced studies.
but more difficult I guess to fit a surgical mask or an N95 on a cartoon rattler head! 🐍
To be fair homemade and surgical masks are almost useless in protecting the wearer compared to N95s.
The whole mask lie really bit the country in the ass, but to be fair when you wear an N95 mask with your nose uncovered, it really isn't going to protect you (have seen this way to many times).
N95 are pretty much useless if he already has it because there's no filter in the exhale.
Some N95s still also have a shortage (use them at work every day).
I have been wearing N95s to go out since February, wash and sanitize my hands prodigiously, don't allow anyone to come over, and only go to the grocery store.
I had a N95 mask and stayed as much distance as I could, but yeah, I was definitely thinking about it.
The docs and nurses performing the endoscopies ~~aren't wearing N95's~~ (edit: crossed out until confirmed tomorrow) and they deal with the most contagious part of the body, inflating it and shooting air into it (throat and stomach).
The docs and nurses performing the endoscopies aren't wearing N95's.
I was under the impression they don't have access to N95 masks like the rest of hospitals and centers near my area having to reuse 3 or 4 masks a head IF they even have them.
I think the block is still in place if you look up trying to buy N95 masks.
I see these N95 valve masks all the time.
I am tired of allergies and these pandemic made me think if I can get N95 or better mask, maybe pollen reaching my sinus can be reduced.
My husband has mowed with an N95 dust mask on for years.
I know its a joke, but 70C dry heat (158F) for 30 mins works to sanitize N95 respirators [per the NIH] --although 85C or 185F is more reliably effective (and will account for thermal measument and heat regulation variance.).
With N95 masks though if you leave it too long it can damage the fibers or the straps become brittle, fyi.
This happened with one of our N95s (apparently we've had them in our disaster kit since 9/11).
My complaint about masks is we arent using N95 and people think these cloth masks are shields.
We needed N95 masks for everyone from day one.
Social distancing/isolation is best, N95 masks are the best if you must, and cloth ones should be seen as very limited protection and treated as such.
I ordered an N95 mask from China in December and it never arrived.
For me it was N95 or nothing because I wanted the fear to be real.
N95 masks for all in Feb plus 1 month social distancing would have nipped this in the bud.
On the very rare occasion one of us has to go somewhere, we have a box of 20 N95 masks I bought in January when we first started reading about this and thought it may be a concern.
It specifically said it does not account for a real person wearing a mask and that would further reduce the effectiveness of the masks especially the non-N95s because of improper fit leakage.
Plus they're reusable and offer better fit and protection than the disposable N95 masks.
Leaves me wondering if the change in PPE rules (N95, single patient use, etc.) is not in itself an economic incentive.
Stay safe out there :(My SO and I bought our own face_shields and use an N95 that someone in /r/houston donated to us layered with a surgical since we only have the one.
Now we wear N95s at work, and those are pretty hard to breathe comfortably in.
We wouldn’t even need to worry about N95 level filtration if people just used a basic covers to limit their particle output.
I bought what I thought were N95 and they were KN95.
Where can I find N95?
KN95 is perfectly fine.
KN95s are now FDA approved which they werent 3 months, only lacking the okay I believe from NIOSH.
They are given N95 masks EVERY MORNING upon entering, along with a temp check.
KN95 has a stricter particulate limit for larger microns but not as strict of a limit for smaller microns as N95.
for the purpose of coronavirus protection, KN95 is good enough.
A cotton face mask ideally with a filter is the bare minimum to protect others, a N95 or equivalent mask is the only mouth/nose protection that offers any significant protection to yourself from said aerosols.
I also write the number of dead and draw corona skulls on my N95.
The protesters were wearing N95 masks?
I have seen N95 masks at ACE in Dallas.
N95 masks  (the ones with the filter) can't even filter the virus.
Thank you for looking out for others! I work at a restaurant that just reopened with my SO, and someone in /r/houston brought us two N95s after I asked where they could be found.
I see almost no one wearing an N95 and even those aren't even close to 100%.
It turns out that wearing an N95 mask is maybe not the best way to keep yourself from getting sick.
In a study published (and largely overlooked) in 2013 in the Journal of Aerosol Medicine and Pulmonary Drug Delivery, it was shown that even a simple surgical mask on a source of aerosol was better at preventing exposure than an N95 on the “healthy subject.”
So they ribbed my husband pretty hard over his mask (we had some N95/99 left from when the ITC chemical fire happened, and use them).
If you are doing it to protect yourself, get the KN95 or N95s.
we are reusing our N95 masks, but there is a big case of atleast 200 of them locked away.
My buddy’s wife is an ER nurse; she gets an N95 and a paper sack to keep in to last four weeks.
I bought a box of 10 3M N95 masks back on Jan.
Gah I don’t even know where to start on all of that - but what it really comes down to is that the mask protects those around you, it does not protect the wearer from incoming droplets (unless you’ve got a well fitted N95 or similar).
The day before duty with the dust masks, someone got the idea to look in the janitor's closet and discovered a box of 30 N95's...
Will school staff need to be fit tested for N95 masks?
N95 masks are designed to filter out 95% of virus sized particles, they don’t filter out most things the size of molecules.
In fact, that’s why N95 (and N100 or P100) masks for industrial used have those bulky cartridges—those are filled with activated carbon or some other absorbent material designed to remove toxic chemicals (until they become saturated).
However, N95 masks, or KN95 masks, or FFP2, and P2 masks do protect the wearer from inhaling the virus.
I've been getting KN95 masks (KN95 is the China variant) and some FFP2 masks (I believe from Japan) from ebay.
They do have some KN95's on there now.
But N95s and even KN95s should really be reserved for medical and first response due to shortages, and the rest of us should be wearing cloth and other masks to prevent spread as our collective responsibility, hence why a government mandate should be acceptable.
If masks only protected yourself and everyone had N95 masks, sure, leave it up to the individual.
But N95s and even KN95s should really be reserved for medical and first response due to shortages,
I would not enter such a place without an N95 mask.
If you don't have an N95, I recommend ordering online or pickup.
You'd need something like an N95 to see any real benefit.
While far less effective than an N95 respirator, a surgical mask can still help to reduce the number of particles breathed in.
You don’t have to be one of those people if you follow the guidelines and wear N95 mask or FDA equivalent in public indoor places.
So wear your seat belt or N95 mask if you are at risk.
There are KN95 masks at gas stations now.
And only buy FDA/CDC tested N95 or equivalent masks.
It is an individual choice at this point as to wear an N95 mask and put on hand sanitizer now that you know even during the lockdown the virus kept spreading.
N95 masks I believe would but the home made cloth ones dont work to keep the droplets out.
WE ALL NEED N95 MASKS NOW!!!!
A massive lie that had people fighting over toilet paper instead of  N95 masks that Trump was shipping to his pals in china
And although I can't speak for everyone I did hear a representative from the CDC back in February and she didn't say mask don't work, in fact she said N95  nask work fine when used properly, but most people don't and what few are available need to be reserved for medical doctors.
This experiment did not include N95 masks and does not reflect the actual transmission of infection from patients with COVID-19 wearing different types of masks.
Further, the government should provide every American with an N95 mask and that would actually stop the spread of the virus if they are as good as people say.
Adams also said that N95 respirator masks aren’t as effective for the general public as one might think, saying N95 masks “have to get fit-tested.”

I also suspect that going somewhere where you inherently increase your respiration rate is going to be unsafe with cloth masks.
I’ve made a ton of cloth masks.
In a pinch, do you think those cloth masks with filter inserts would help?
You see the cloth masks don't necessarily stop the aerosol but cause it not to initially travel as far as giving it time to dilute in the air.
This is why even with cloth masks you need the physical distance otherwise you could end up breathing in aerosol that still contains enough of a concentration for transmission.
Cloth masks and social distancing won't matter if you are in that environment for a long enough if breathe aerosol is allowed to build up and is shared among everyone.
“, we have measured the filtration efficiencies of various commonly available fabrics for use as cloth masks in filtering particles in the significant (for aerosol-based virus transmission) size range of ∼10 nm to ∼6 μm and have presented filtration efficiency data as a function of aerosol particle size.
My retired parents have resumed their routine of walking at the mall, dining in restaurants, and frequent grocery shopping and they insist it is safe because they are wearing cloth masks.
Cloth mask usage should have been pushed as an official option way back in March instead of Fauci lying about mask ineffectiveness.
They're asking people to wear 'home made cloth' masks.
That was exactly my thinking in early March when I starting wearing a cloth mask even though people were still spouting the "it will make you touch your face more" line.
There is also ZERO credible *scientific evidence* that non-medical, home made cloth masks help prevent the spread of the virus.
Even if you know of past example, you can't just assume that cloth masks are going to do anything in a new case.
Can you provide just ONE peer-reviewed scientific paper demonstrating that homemade cloth masks prevent the spread of SARS-CoV2?
I realize that the mods will probably delete this post too, because it doesn't fit their narrative & you *can't risk* an *open discussion* on the subject but here goes: **The very link you provided examined P2 and clinical surgical masks - and NOT homemade cloth masks** (as I clearly stated in the above post that you censored & DELETED).
You have still **failed to show any studies** demonstrating any (quote from my post above): "credible scientific evidence that non-medical, home made cloth masks help prevent the spread of the virus." - perhaps that's because you were unable to find one??
If everyone knows what is expected, you are the shit bag if you say fuck you all I'm not putting a piece of cloth on my face.
And the order makes it pretty clear that options are easily available to anyone who owns cloth.
The term 'Face Covering' includes, but is not limited to, cloth face masks, surgical masks, towels, scarves, and bandanas." They are already easily available to start.
You have presented only conflicting data which suggests to me that wearing a cloth  or linen mask simply isn't good enough to protect one's self from viral particles.
The point of posting these papers was to show that cloth and/or surgical masks have a protective value to the wearer which was highly disputed for the last couple months.
Many people were speculating that surgical/cloth masks only protect people from the wearer and not the other way around.
(:21) Use a cloth covering, wash your hands, etc.
AZ ppl can wear cloth covering when can't distance, stay home when sick.
13:40 "Anybody who had seen my interview a few months ago knows I did not routinely wear masks in public and I want everyone to know I have changed my position on wearing cloth masks.
Now there is a mounting body of scientific evidence that shows that cloth face masks, well-fitting cloth face masks, can actually prevent COVID-19 from spreading.
There is even some evidence that the person wearing the cloth face mask can decrease their exposure by around 60% particularly if the mask is made well and fits well.
We have paper surgical masks provided by the company, and some people have obtained cloth masks for themselves.
The idiots on this sub Reddit have been completely brainwashed into believing this virus is the most deadliest thing in the world and their only protection is a cloth mask that most of them don’t ever wash.
[Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn by children under the age of 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.
People who are engaged in high intensity activities, like running, may not be able to wear a cloth face covering if it causes difficulty breathing.].
God forbid you be inconvenienced by having to even wear a piece of cloth whilst breathing.
The cloth masks prevent the virus from becoming aerosolized in coughs and sneezes.
Cloth and paper masks don't stop the virus from entering through into someone's mouth or nose.
And cloth or paper masks don't stop viruses, just big droplets.
Prepare to offer at least cloth masks and require hand washing upon entry.
We’re out here making cloth masks for our medical people (!!!), while our President (bringing manufacturing back), is “the best back up for our states” but says our states should find their own supplies.
FWIW, there are some decent 3d printed designs with multiple layers (cloth + hvac filter cloth) that likely get you pretty close to an n95.
It's not FDA approved or anything, but it's likely better than a surgical mask and absolutely better than cloth.
Now I just use a surgical mask with a triple layer cloth mask and a face shield.
I’ve played with a bunch of different mask templates, finally got a cloth template that fits well and securely to my face with minimal gaps.
Old, sickly people going shopping and having people over and claiming it's OK because they're wearing cloth masks.
Do not trust your life to cloth masks.
None of them used a cloth or glove or any barrier.
Here is a trial of cloth masks and surgical masks.
Cloth masks and surgical masks block recipient from droplets, and somewhat for aerosols--but must try to limit crowded conditions, especially indoors.
I really wish that a piece of cloth wasn’t so politicized, I’d really like to leave the house, and I hope sometime this year I’ll be able to safely get a haircut, but 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
Way to put it out there! So many people hate being forced to wear a cloth on their faces.
If you are going to double mask, why put the cloth under the surgical?
I'd want the surgical closer to the face, putting it over the cloth gives more airway around it.
I agree on the order of masks that you proposed, but the cloth mask was a kid's sized mask so it wouldn't have fit over the surgical mask.
Cloth masks and surgical masks do not protect the wearer.
You are fine wearing a cloth mask people who are saying anything besides an n95 is useless are stupid as fuck.
At a grocery store where everyone is wearing a mask, a cloth mask is the right call.
Cloth face coverings are recommended as a simple barrier to help **prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the cloth face covering coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice**.
This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows cloth face coverings **reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth**.
COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of cloth face coverings is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Cloth masks protect others from you.
There are multiple studies showing that cloth masks reduce your risk of inhaling infective respiratory droplets, you are trying to sound smart but you just look stupid.
Cloth one droop after a while too.
FYI those bandana type masks are not very effective in comparison with a real cloth or surgical mask.
The cloth masks droop and stretch.
I have just a plain cloth one that stretches.
Saves on a LOT of paper towels and using scrap cloth that would otherwise get tossed.
I have a n95 masks with filters I trade between (put them in the sun), and cloth masks...I don't have much money after all of the medical treatment I've needed, so I hope those are okay?
And do everyone else a favor and stick some cloth over the outlet valve.
Sheeple keeping their genitals behind cloth.
I’ve personally taken to keeping my clean cloth masks in a closed container with a fabric softener sheet inside, like after I run laundry I’ll stick the masks and the dryer sheet in the box.
Just hand wash it in warm soapy water whenever it starts to get gamey (assuming it’s cloth) and dry it in the sun.
The hostess had a cloth mask around her neck.
The horror of watching other companies not give a shit, homemade cloth face masks, products sitting out exposed to the room, brushes not separated for each person and kept away from other clients, touching their face mask then a surface....
I have not gone anywhere really, so I bought a bunch of cloth ones on Etsy.
I'm comfortable with a cloth mask but I still run away from everyone I see.
I’d even do a surgical mask under my cloth mask...
They’re better than cloth masks even with a filter.
If you get a seal around the mask using one of these mask braces, your mask goes beyond protecting others from you if you're asymptomatic; your mask actually you from others, which is something a mere cloth mask isn't very good at doing.
Indeed it's mostly just a grouping of data that show actual surgical masks, respirators, or multi layered cloth mask is much better than a bandana.
When I finally got around her I noticed she wasn’t wearing a mask, but had some cloth around her neck to pull up if needed.
4 layers of paper towel w/ 1 layer cloth - 95.15% effective.
They were not as effective when only using cloth or less paper towels in conjunction.
[Here is one of the studies they reference when they say single cloth layer masks were not as effective.].
In short, surgical masks were 3x more effective than single layer cloth masks.
The surgical masks were best due to having the greatest "fit factor" which is how they measured the seal in tandem with the pressure drop measured across the cloth layer.
Edit* [The other referenced study to single layer cloth mask efficacy.].
"Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
**Conclusions** This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.
Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.
Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally.
However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated."
Is this still just talking about single layer cloth masks?
They know now that masks help to reduce COVID-19 but still  if people wear them incorrectly they are still at huge risks and medical masks and n-95s are superior to cloth.
All I have to do is wear a piece of shitty cloth over my face and I can rub myself against people and spew my microscopic bio organisms into the air and guarantee others won't get sick.
Surgical or cloth masks do not protect you, they protect others from you.
Actual question, no snark, but what are the medical conditions that keep people from wearing even cloth masks?
Surgical is only good for 30 mins at a time and with cloth your basically wearing nothing.
Study after study says that O2 levels do *NOT* drop when using a surgical or cloth mask.
Why is putting on a piece of cloth so intimidating to people?
Simple will reveal that the micron size of breath aerosol is smaller than the holes in a cheap ear loop mask or even worse a homemade cloth mask.
Southern hospitality ends at wearing a piece of cloth to save other lives.
I bought my wife and i extra reusable cloth masks and a box of disposable to try and beat the rush.
Cloth masks should be fine.
The mask, even the basic cloth ones, are more of a shield helping to stop you from spread it.
People are conveniently forgetting that the CDC itself didnt think cloth masks would matter much either.
What I hate about seeing people with cloth masks at the supermarket is how they often feel it "exempts" them from social distancing.
Cloth masks plus no social distancing slows it down only if the number of contacts increases less than the risk factor reduction (5x less risk per contact is negated by 10x more contact).
Thick cloth face mask.
Viruses attack the weak, whether that is you or me or family members, science will not be changed by donning a cloth mask.
[Simple Respiratory Protection—Evaluation of the Filtration Performance of Cloth Masks and Common Fabric Materials Against 20–1000 nm Size Particles].
This study only shows what would happen if only one person was wearing a cloth mask and then getting particles sprayed at a set velocity onto that mask.
Old people are back out, yes with masks but usually just cloth...
If you're using a cloth mask, sew a few pipe cleaners at the top edge and bend them to fit your face.
However, the virus does not propel itself though the air on its own! Its "delivery system" is to hitch a ride on mucus particles that are breathed out by infected individuals, which are much larger and can be contained by a cloth mask.
to pack up their rooms) called for districts to "consider having all employees wear cloth face coverings (over the nose and mouth)."
CLOTH MASKS BLOCK THE PRIMARY MODE OF CORONAVIRUS TRANSMISSION.
But, fortunately cloth masks can block both droplets and aerosols.
Why is it okay for the government to force people to wear clothes but we draw the line when the piece of cloth covers your face?
I wear a cloth mask walking several hundred yards to my car, so I see the snarky looks and snickering.
I go to the store and get dirty looks just in a flimsy cloth mask.
Now I just stay away from those who don't want to wear a simple piece of cloth or paper for my and their protection.
Now that they're available again- especially cloth masks, the narrative is changing.
No one is gonna have their freedoms stripped from them or lose their liberties from wearing a piece of cloth over their face.
Will you please wear at least a thin cloth mask in public anyway?
this was just before the CDC started recommending "cloth face coverings" but i was livid.
A strip of even N100 grade filtration cloth draped over your face provides no protection.
Here's a study from a medical journal called **Aerosol Filtration Efficiency of Common Fabrics Used in Respiratory Cloth Masks**
This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19.
However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks.
Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies.
Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of “fit” and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently.
Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.*
*In conclusion, we have measured the filtration efficiencies of various commonly available fabrics for use as cloth masks in filtering particles in the significant (for aerosol-based virus transmission) size range of ∼10 nm to ∼6 μm and have presented filtration efficiency data as a function of aerosol particle size.
Opportunities for future studies include cloth mask design for better “fit” and the role of factors such as humidity (arising from exhalation) and the role of repeated use and washing of cloth masks.
In summary, we find that the use of cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of particles in the aerosol size range.*
Especially these bullshit cloth masks that people are buying /making at home.
Cloth masks do more to prevent you from spreading things than keeping you from catching things, that is true.
And you wear cloth masks, dust masks, and the like, to protect others and reduce community spread, more than protecting yourself.
It has a better seal than the cloth ones I've tried, and far better filtratrion.
But with most people relying on cloth and paper masks, then *everyone* must wear them.
But with most people relying on cloth and paper masks, then everyone must wear them.
They should have talked up cloth face masks in the beginning instead of lying and acting like masks only magically work for medical professionals.
A cloth mask is a bad idea all around.
People are getting so bothered about being asked to wear a piece of cloth over their nose and mouth.
A virus doesn't come with a 6' leash nor is it impeded in any way by a strip of porous cloth that vents all the way around.
Doctors: " both surgical and cloth masks are not effective in stopping the spread of the virus.
Why the downvotes for this chap?--nibbas got a valid point (edit: this doesn't mean I agree that cloth masks are useless, though).
But surgical masks, dust masks, even cloth masks do catch much of the larger water/mucus droplets that the wearer breathes *out*.
I wonder if the mask system Vistaprint is selling online works - they are cloth and have disposable filters you can insert for so many hours a day.
Yet in Austin, you can't even buy the cloth-based masks at any local retailer, not to mention the 10¢ surgical masks.
They’re not exempting them because they don’t have cloth to cover their faces with.
Or the ones that say to wear a cloth face mask yet study after study show less than 5% effective for all.
If it scares them & they get to feel righteous, virtue signaling from behind a useless strip of cloth, then it's REAL NEWS.
If science is your thing why do you believe a strip of cloth can in any way filter out a microscopic pathogen?
One study showed that masks worn by patients with the virus accumulated more of the virus on the outside of the mask than the inside (this was true for both cloth and surgical masks).
Simple cloth masks do more to slow what comes out of your mouth than blocking what's coming at you.
Simple cloth masks, while absolutely offer some protection for the wearer, mostly slow/stop what we are coughing/sneezing/breathing out.
Only an idiot would think a microorganism comes with a 6' leash or that a pretty rectangle of cloth on their face would slow it down.
If you're going to ease restrictions, fine, but how f*ing hard is it to wear a cloth covering, wash your hands, and use hand sanitizer, and cough into your elbow.
Cloth masks only 5%.
The point is making fun of someone for being cautious not the efficacy of masks.The CDC recommends wearing them,cloth or otherwise.Anything you can do to prevent catching the virus is prudent.
Just Google "study of cloth masks" for pages of sources.
Where does that say cloth masks are 5 percent effective?
If your hand is contaminated and you touch your mask your mask is now contaminated and if it's some homemade cloth type you are now just sucking the virus through the surface into your lungs.
Oh yeah, that's not great: Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
That study basically says that the cloth mask filtered 0% when they tested it.
Sounds to me like they're using cloth that you could observe daylight through in a pitch black room!
I think a quality cloth mask would likely be relatively effective in our scenario if you really think about it.
I mean...a quality cloth mask is probably the definition of a surgical mask.
Good find on that study...one interesting point though (that they sort of explained) was that even though the cloth mask wearing individuals displayed higher illness rates, it's could very well have been caused when the users were taking the mask home to wash them.
I have cloth masks made by people in their homes.
There are instructions all over the place to make your own cloth mask, but I just use a bandana.
We are talking about masks and if it's down to which one is riskier there's still no reason not to wear a cloth one to the store.
The new facial-covering rule, signed into law Thursday by Mayor Ron Nirenberg and County Judge Nelson Wolff, requires everyone 10 years or older to wear a cloth mask, scarf, bandanna or other similar item over the nose and mouth in public places where it is difficult to stay six feet away from others.
Wearing a cloth over your mouth for your medical benefit is apparently destruction of your freedom.
🤞I hope soon! I never imagined I’d be the type of mom who cloth diapered...
You can use a dish cloth or another filter if you'd rather though.
A few cloth masks per person that can be washed without running the laundry each day.
I saw a dude with a really cool cloth mask today, looked custom.
I made cloth masks and wear one whenever I have to go into a business or come into contact (even with the appropriate distance) with anyone outside my live-in family.
I went to the grocery store yesterday and did wear my cloth mask.
I’ve stopped going inside any store, but my last Walmart pharmacy run I wore a cloth mask with a doubled up bandana over it.
I'm on a local discord server and explained how even a t shirt or cloth could be effective in the prevention of spreading it, and non confrontationally and in a friendly way, during a conversation about grocery shopping and stuff, explained that the main reason masks or face coverings are important is that it helps prevent the spread to others, and for one dude, either it wasn't explained to him like that before, or he didn't trust the information he'd received, but it clicked and he was like "oh.
I bought some cloth masks with filters from a friend of a friend who is sewing them, and I wear that now.
Sewn cloth masks will NOT protect you.
I am getting filters for the cloth masks too.
Discard the shop towel and drop the cloth directly in to a washer or a pot of water to boil then wash your hands.
I would be happy to make you a couple of washable cloth masks.
Yes, please wear something, cotton, terry cloth lots of youtube video's showing non-sewing ways of making one; even a bandana just tied behind your head.
YOU wearing a cloth mask helps keep YOU from spreading YOUR germs to others.
Most cloth masks work fairly well with a paper mask over or under.
My mom has to wear cloth masks under her PPE mask due to skin irritation and it works for her :).
You don't want to wear the vacuum bag piece next to your skin so you could make a little cloth pouch for it.
Now that they decided cloth masks are ok to wear, maybe Joanne's for fabric, but Michael's?
Great! I have a cloth one with a pocket inside.
As far as I am aware, filters can still be purchased, these homemade cloth masks are washable and reusable.
If it’s cloth based put it in a washing machine.
I’m thankful for those making home made cloth masks.
'm going to have to say that it would help, even simple cloth masks, mainly because they can/will catch some droplets/particles.
I've worn a cloth mask and goggles to work the past week.
Hospitals will take even cloth masks at this point.
If we want PPE to catch on, from standard PPE to homemade cloth masks, we need to find a way to reduce the stigma.
Companies are making nice cloth ones which may not be good but are better than nothing for the general public.
They will be expired but honestly they are just packed with layers of cloth and unsaturated charcoal, which is enough.
I'm the odd one because I keep insisting 6 foot distance and have a cloth mask.
I'm going to find moldable metal or plastic in bulk that can be sewn to the top of the nose and leave pockets in the layered cloth part into which a carbon filter can be inserted.
Even homemade cloth masks or bandannas are better than nothing.
Check ETSY for sewn cloth ones.
What did you use for filter, just cloth?
Most will fit the filter material within a cloth.
The other day I saw someone wearing a cloth mask, took it off with his bare hands, touched some stuff and then put the mask back on.
A cloth mask only reduces transmission by 35%~, but that's still better than nothing.
He's my first so I'm just winging it! A set of 6-12 cloth diapers would get you through a day or two if you wanted to go that far.
I ordered the "tube bananas" and some basic cloth nose mouth masks.
Cloth diapering is viable.
It's not ideal, but if diapers are hard to come by, cloth diapering is easy, and dirt cheap.
It's been a hot minute, but 3 of my kids were in cloth.
I participated in the great cloth diaper challenge.
The cashiers have these neat plexiglass shields around them that they can open and close if they need to step out and scan items.
Put up plexiglass between back to back booths.
Can’t comment about taking temps but I didn’t see any plexiglass and those groups were NOT 6 feet apart by any stretch of the imagination.
We were talking after seeing the CDC's guidelines about masks, distancing, etc, and she said, "If going back to school means that my students have to wear a mask, and I have to wear a mask, and have plexiglass dividers between each student, with no recess or time that students can socialize, then I don't want to go back."
\-I used very thick plexiglass for the viewport (so that I can see into the box and check to make sure the light is working).
The teachers have been busy building plexiglass separations for their classrooms.
Large plexiglass shields have been installed for my front office staff.
Plexiglass barriers between work stations, and eliminating regular activities that involve close contact and/or hard breathing, especially indoors (basketball, choir).
Practically, plexiglass dividers are a no-go.
And have you looked into how much this plexiglass costs?
Preach sis! If masks, temp checks, plexiglass, millions of $$$ of PPE are needed to function, should we even be congregating in already crowded schools?!
I wanna see restaurant tables in parking lots and plexiglass panels in bars.
Instead of putting up plexiglass partitions and wearing masks, they put up a rope in front of the counter.
My teaching and admin experience is entirely in 6-12 so I don't claim to know but the daycare/ Pre-K we use has little plexiglass cubicles and dividers.
There was a sign at the checkout asking customers to stay on the other side of the plexiglass protecting the cashier, but I couldn't do that because I had to bag my own groceries.
She had a plexiglass guard up at least.
We have the stickers at the registers and plexiglass shields.
Also installing plexiglass barriers between cashiers and the customers.
— He added that while goggles and eye or face shields are “not universally recommended” at this time, “if you really want to be complete, you should probably use it if you can.” —
People are free to choose, but goggles will give you an added protection.
lol you guys think a mask can stop a coronavirus cell, an m95 mask can stop large droplets, not air particles, and if you care so much about not  getting sick, where are your fucking  goggles?
(also if you DO wear a mask, you're still at quite a high level of risk; you can contract it through contact with aerosols via your eyes - to mitigate this risk; wear eye coverings, goggles, face shield, etc).
Bring some goggles too.
I remember reading a story of an epidemiologist saying he got infected on a plane and the only PPE he didn’t wear that usually does was goggles.
Definitely wear goggles.
PS - if you board the plane wearing a mask, goggles and rain jacket please take a selfie, lol!
The mask (along with goggles, etc.
Still the goggles are a reasonable safety measures.
I just ordered some goggles on amazon.
At any rate, I would certainly wear goggles along with a mask if I had to fly, since it’s unclear at this point if infection can occur through the eyes.
I think I have an old pair of cheap "goggles" you put your phone in.
If it's really crowded wear safety goggles.
* Face Shields or Goggles.
Really all they need is a mask and goggles for 99% of the same protection.
I just purchased yesterday: scrub pants, a lab coat, face shield, washable masks with a filter pocket, filters, disposable shoe covers, and safety goggles.
Anti-splash lab goggles and some kinds of tactical goggles / glasses will do.
It’s going to be straight to the office with my double masks, goggles and closed door and straight home to decontaminate.
The only thing I think I might have done differently is wear lab goggles when I went out.
Wear a mask and goggles for errands
And MUST wear safety glasses or goggles.
Masks and goggles would help mitigate the impact of pepper spray.
Other than most staying in cars, bullhorns, face shields, goggles, and hepa masks would be ideal.
Nope!!! I bought goggles for my entire family as well.
It was later discovered that the procedure of removing the goggles last, became the root cause of healthcare workers becoming infected with Ebola.
Well because there might have been droplets from the patient on the goggles, and when they removed the goggles last, with their bare hands, it would later infect them from any open wounds or any opening of the body.
Did your relative have goggles?
Probably won't go out again before then, but if I do I'll probably add goggles to the ersatz PPE.
Yes, actual masks and goggles.
Or even wear goggles for better protection!
Not sure what I will do, face shield or glasses/goggles, I think face shield might not fog up as easily as goggles.
Now if I only had some prescription anti-fog swim goggles....
so maybe add goggles?
Judging by OPs story I really hope he gets goggles soon.
Masks and goggles are totally gone.
Like gowns made out of plastic bags, and masks and respirators that don't work?
PPE shortages are STILL a huge problem with nurses and doctors reusing n95s, masks, gowns well beyond their recommended use.
I've also got N95s, face shields, gowns, hair nets...
They need masks, gowns, face shields, gloves, shoe and head covers.
* Isolation Gowns.
I wear a p-100 mask, face shield, bonnet, bouffant cap, gown, gloves, and about ten pounds of sweat everywhere I go all night.
Perhaps the relevant "info" you desire might be available if you "gown-up" and take a little tour beyond those doors yourself?
No need to gown up and tour when most facilities have closed and moved to telemedicine.
I wear a mask, face shield, gloves 8 hrs daily and gowns when necessary.
Our 'gowns' are a joke.
Full gown, gloves, mask, face shield etc.
Anyone seeing a patient with COVID-19 is required to wear two sets of masks, gowns, gloves, shoe and head coverings, and a face shield.
Yeah I like the dude standing there in a mask and gown with a picture on his chest of himself in a mask and gown.
I work in a surgery center doing mostly elective cases, using PPE daily (masks, face shields, shoe covers, gowns, etc) while hospitals that severely need these things are running out.
Wife & team received a box of gowns without a back a few days ago, material seemed real thin too.
I keep seeing ”reassuring“ numbers about masks, gowns, beds being available.
All that come through the door are gowned for droplet contact and we are not allowed to leave the room.
Then where the heck is it going because nurses are still REUSING MASKS AND GOWNS.
Keep in mind the vast majority of masks ppe gowns etc are coming out of China.
Only have 10 gowns for the day?
It's actually a certain grade of cedar pulp that's primarily produced at a mill in Canada and is used in more than masks, like medical gowns.
Everyone forgets about gowns.
People seem to be all about the masks but we are rationing gowns in a bad way and that’s just as dangerous.
Since I was at the hospital (gowned, gloved and masked, but still) I have been self isolating and I will not attend her burial as her siblings are older and have health issues.
She did gown up and wore a face shield for the swab, just because people usually cough/gag/sometimes vomit.
Shouldn't the petition instead be asking them to get masks, gloves, face shields, gowns...appropriate PPE?
Not even a surgical mask/gown.
We now have 7 n95s and 5 surgical masks along with 3 full gowns/face shields.
Don't like your gowns,  go get a Dow tyvek chemical suit for less than $10.
They had to train everyone on the PAPR system which is the hood with a hose that blows clean air into it, and wearing the contact isolation gowns.
If it weren’t for the shortage it would just be the n95 and gowns.
I see many people touching their face, touching the mask, removing half of it for a break, etc.
I would feel better if the pickup delivery employee had a mask on.
This better not be unpopular! I fully agree with you, lots of people will continue to come into contact with you, so if you end up getting C19, but are asymptomatic - your wearing a mask - even a bandana, which is what the CDC is telling health care workers to wear if they run out of PPE - may prevent you from spreading it to someone else.
Everyone who has to be out of their house should at least wear a homemade mask with replaceable filter.
I wear a mask when I go out and I don’t have to check out hundreds of customers at the register.
Whatever you do, don’t touch your face until you can wash your hands for 20+ seconds with soap and be very careful taking off that mask/bandanna since it requires your hands to come into contact with your face.
I think you're right to wear a mask.
The number of microorganisms isolated from coughs of healthy volunteers wearing their homemade mask, a surgical mask, or no mask was compared using several air-sampling techniques.
Both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers, although the surgical mask was 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the homemade mask.
Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.
We went to 7/11 in Lubbock, where the cashier was wearing a mask, and some drunk asshole came in and started hassling him about it.
